<h3>DOWNSTAIRS IN THE DARK.</h3>
<div><img class="left" src="images/img006a.jpg" height="60" alt="E" title="" /></div>
<p class="noindent">lsie pushed
away the bed-clothes
which were
covering her ear, and
listened; then she sat
up in bed, and listened
again.</p>

<p>There was no doubt
that it was an actual
sound, and not mere
imagination. How
long it had been going
on, or when it first began to mingle in a confused
manner with her dreams, she could not say; but
now she heard it plainly enough, and recognized
what it was&mdash;the peculiar, grating hiss of a grindstone,
punctuated every now and then with a subdued
little squeak made by the treadle.</p>

<div><img class="figleft" src="images/img006.jpg" height="300" alt="ELSIE" /></div>

<p>Who on earth should want to be grinding anything
at that time of night?</p>

<p>The Pines was a rambling old house; the girls
always slept with their window open; and just below
was an outbuilding, part of which was used as a
tool-house, in which stood the grindstone; and thus
the sound had reached Elsie at a moment when
perhaps her slumber was not as deep as usual. The
noise continued, with pauses at regular intervals,
when whatever was being sharpened was removed
from the stone. Taking care not to disturb her
elder sister, Ida, whose heavy breathing showed
that she was sound asleep, the little girl slipped
out of bed, and crept softly over to the window.
By straining her neck, and pressing her cheek close
against the pane, she could just get a glimpse of the
tool-house window, which she noticed was faintly
illuminated, as it might have been by the feeble rays
of a night-light.</p>

<p>A sudden thought occurred to Elsie that it must
be her cousin, Brian Seaton, who lived at the Pines,
and went to school with her brother Guy. Brian
was always boat-building; sometimes he sat up
later than he ought to have done, and continued to
work long after every one else was in bed. No
doubt the rascal was doing so now, and had stolen
down to put a fresh edge on his chisel. Elsie was
a spirited young monkey, and she and Brian were
great chums.</p>

<p>"I'll just creep down and show him I've found
him out," she said to herself. "What fun to take
him by surprise!"</p>

<p>To put on dressing-gown and slippers was but the
work of a few moments. Softly opening the bedroom
door, she passed out on to the landing, and
groping in the darkness until she found the rail of
the banisters, she proceeded down the stairs.</p>

<p>How still and quiet the house seemed! Nothing
broke the silence but the solemn "tick-tack" of the
big clock in the hall, which had been ticking in the
same sedate manner since the days when Elsie's
grandmother had been a little girl. Feeling her way
down the length of the hall, not without an occasional
bump against chairs and other such obstacles,
Elsie came to a little lobby or cloak-room, having at
the farther end a half-glass door, which opened on
the yard, and from which the tool-house was distant
not more than a dozen paces. She quite expected
to find this door open, and was surprised to discover
that it was not only shut, but locked on the inside.</p>

<p>"What a beggar Brian is!" thought the girl.
"He must have climbed out of his window, and
come down the water-pipe, as he did one day last
summer."</p>

<p>She laid her hand on the key, when a low growling
noise gave her quite a little fright, until she
remembered that it was the old clock in the hall
preparing to strike&mdash;"clearing his throat," as Ida
called the operation. The next moment the bell
struck&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ting! ting!"</p>

<p>Elsie listened with a gasp of astonishment; the
old clock ignored the halves and quarters, so the time
must be two o'clock in the morning! She never
remembered having been up so early or so late
before, and the thought that she was wandering
about the house at that unearthly hour made her
feel quite queer.</p>

<p>"What can Brian be about?" she murmured.
"He can't have been sitting up working till this
time."</p>

<p>She turned the handle of the door, and stepped
across the threshold. The cold night air made her
shiver, the whir of the grindstone came clear and
distinct from the tool-house, and the window still
gleamed with the same subdued, ghostly light. Elsie
had intended to rush across the flagstones, fling open
the door, shout "Brian, go to bed!" and then herself
beat a hasty retreat; but, just when she was on the
point of doing so, she hesitated.</p>

<p>What if it shouldn't be Brian after all? And if
it were not her cousin, who or what could be there
in the tool-house turning the grindstone at two
o'clock in the morning?</p>

<p>It is when we pause to think that fear often
takes hold of us. Elsie was a brave child; but,
somehow, just then her courage seemed to desert her.
She remained for an instant listening to the whispering
of the night wind, and the mysterious sound
which had first roused her from her slumbers; then
she drew back in sudden panic, locked the door as if
in the fear of some lion, and went quickly back the
way she had come.</p>

<p>"Tick-tack! tick-tack!" muttered the old clock.
He never felt afraid at having to stand alone all
night in the darkness. Elsie hurried past him, and
after one or two stumbles on the stairs, regained her
bedroom.</p>

<p>"Ida! Wake up!"</p>

<p>"Every one of my sums is right," murmured Ida
drowsily. "You can always get them right with a
blue pencil."</p>

<p>"Wake up, Ida! I want to tell you something."</p>

<p>"Oh, bother!" grumbled the elder girl. "What's
the matter, Elsie? What d'you want to keep shaking
me for when I'm sound asleep?"</p>

<p>"Why, I want to tell you there's some one turning
our grindstone."</p>

<p>"Well, what if they are? I suppose it's meant to
be turned."</p>

<p>"But not now. It's two o'clock in the morning.
No one ought to be about there at this time."</p>

<p>Ida sat up, rubbed her eyes, and yawned.</p>

<p>"What d'you mean?" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Listen!" was the answer. "You'll hear the noise.
Some one was working the grindstone. Why, I heard
the little squeak of the treadle as plainly as anything."</p>

<p>"You have been dreaming, you little silly!"</p>

<p>"No, I <i>haven't</i>! What I say is quite true."</p>

<p>There was something in the speaker's tone which
showed that she was very much in earnest.</p>

<p>"And you mean to say that you've been all the
way downstairs?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I went to the yard door. I meant to have
gone across to the tool-house, but I was frightened."</p>

<p>"Well, if any one was there, it must have been
Guy or Brian&mdash;probably Brian, for he's the only one
who can sharpen tools. I'll go across and ask."</p>

<p>Throwing the dressing-gown over her shoulders, Ida
left the room. She still did not believe that either of
the boys had been up at that unearthly hour using
the grindstone, but she wished to prove to Elsie that
it was all imagination. As she passed the head of
the stairs she suddenly stopped. Somewhere, down
below, she distinctly heard a soft noise like the patter
of slippered feet. Ida leant over the banisters.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="images/img012.jpg" width="140" alt="BOB" /></p>

<p>"Brian!" she cried in a whisper. "What are you
doing?"</p>

<p>There was a scuffling noise, and
a moment later, to the girl's astonishment,
a black dog came jumping
up the stairs as fast as it could go.</p>

<p>"Why, Bob, you rascal, whatever
brings you in here?"</p>

<p>The dog capered about with a whining noise,
which showed his delight.</p>

<p>"Hush! don't bark!" commanded the girl; "you
ought to be in your kennel. Go downstairs, and
lie on the mat."</p>

<p>The dog obeyed, and pattered off down the stairs,
while Ida went on and tapped at the door of the
room in which the two boys slept. The knocking
had to be repeated several times before there was
any answer. At last there came a sleepy, "All ri'.
What 'er want?"</p>

<p>"Have you been down turning the grindstone in
the tool-house, Guy?"</p>

<p>"No, of course not."</p>

<p>"Has Brian?"</p>

<p>"No; he's here asleep."</p>

<p>"Have either of you been down there?"</p>

<p>"No, you stupid!"</p>

<p>"Well, some one's let Bob into the house."</p>

<p>"Oh, bother Bob! I say, Ida, you are a fool to
go waking a fellow up like this. What's the joke?"</p>

<p>"It's no joke," she said. "Good-night; go to sleep."</p>

<p>"You are a little noodle, Elsie!" Ida exclaimed as
she jumped back into bed, her teeth chattering with
the cold. "The boys are both in bed, and haven't
been near the tool-house. And d'you know what
you've done? You've let in Bob."</p>

<p>"I'm sure I didn't."</p>

<p>"But you <i>did</i>. He's just run upstairs. He must
have slipped in when you opened the yard door.
His collar's broken, and he gets loose sometimes."</p>

<p>"I'm sure he didn't come into the house when I
opened the door," persisted Elsie. "I only stood
there half a minute. The servants must have let
him in when they were locking up."</p>

<p>"Well, if it was a robber working the grindstone,"
answered Ida jokingly, "he can't get into the house
without Bob barking and waking everybody up.
Now, good-night; don't wake me up again."</p>

<p>Ida's breathing soon showed that she was once
more in the land of dreams, but try as Elsie would
she could not get off to sleep. As often as she closed
her eyes she seemed to see the dark outline of the
tool-house, the single window illuminated with a
ghostly glimmer, and again she heard the hiss and
whir of the grindstone as she had heard it before.</p>

<p>Who could have been at work there, if Guy and
Brian were both in bed? If she had run across and
opened the door of the little den, what would she
have seen? She was still lying awake thinking, when
the old clock downstairs struck three. Gradually
her excitement gave place to a sensation of
drowsiness, and at length she fell asleep. Even now her
puzzled brain was not quite content to let her rest.
In her dreams she once more went downstairs, and
this time the door of the tool-house opened, and out
came the grindstone of its own accord, staggering
along on its wooden stand, and whizzing round all
the time with a buzzing sound like a big angry bee.
It chased her along endless passages, and up and
down countless flights of stairs. Then Brian appeared
on the scene; she rushed forward to beg his
help, and in doing so awoke to find that she was in
bed.</p>

<h3>THE LOST CARVING-KNIFE.</h3>
<div><img class="left" src="images/img016.jpg" width="120" alt="T" title="" /></div>
<p class="noindent">here was a great deal of chattering
going on at the breakfast
table next morning, seldom less
than two people talking at once.</p>

<p>"Look here, Ida," cried Guy;
"next time you come waking me
up in the middle of the night, I'll have a sponge of
cold water ready for you; see if I don't!"</p>

<p>"I tell you it was Elsie's fault," was the answer.
"She declared she heard some one turning the grindstone."</p>

<p>"Well, so I did," persisted Elsie, who did not like
her word being doubted. "I heard it quite plainly;
and there was a light in the tool-house."</p>

<p>"Are you sure you were not dreaming?" asked
Mrs. Ormond.</p>

<p>"Yes, quite sure, mother."</p>

<p>"Did you grind any of your tools last night,
Brian?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, aunt. I haven't touched the grindstone
for a week at least. Besides, I'm too fond of bed
to get up and sharpen chisels at two o'clock in the
morning."</p>

<p>The speaker was a sturdy, good-natured boy, two
years older than Guy, and greatly distinguished this
term by having received the cap of the Rexbury
Grammar School football team.</p>

<p>"You two girls are a couple of noodles," went on
Guy. "I suppose you thought it was a ghost working
at the stone?"</p>

<p>"Well, look here," cried Ida, anxious to turn the
conversation; "who let Bob in last night? Elsie
says she didn't, but he was in the house when I came
over to your room."</p>

<p>"He was fastened up when I crossed the yard
about eight o'clock last night," said Brian.</p>

<p>"Where did you find him this morning, Jane?"
asked Ida, turning to the parlour-maid.</p>

<p>"He was outside, chained up to his kennel, miss,"
was the answer.</p>

<p>"Outside! But when he was once in the house
he couldn't possibly get out again. He came
running up the stairs, and I couldn't think what it was
for a minute."</p>

<p>"He was in his kennel when we came down this
morning, miss," said Jane.</p>

<p>Guy burst out into a roar of laughter.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm blest!" he cried. "You are a pair!
First there's Elsie's yarn about that grindstone, and
now you try to stuff some silly story into us of Bob's
running about the house when he was outside all the
time."</p>

<p>"But he <i>was</i> in the house," cried Ida, flushing.
"He came upstairs to me, and I sent him down
again."</p>

<p>"Then if he was in the house, will you tell me
how he could have got out again before the servants
came down to open the door? You girls must have
eaten something for supper last night that didn't
agree with you, and both had nightmare. Next time
you get it, don't come across to our door."</p>

<p>"Now, now!" interrupted Mrs. Ormond, who saw
that Ida was about to make an angry retort, and
judged that the discussion had gone far enough.
"Come, you boys will be late if you don't make
haste with your breakfast. Are you going to play
football this afternoon, Brian?"</p>

<p>"Yes, aunt; it's a match."</p>

<p>"Shall you want to take your things with you?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you. The game's on our ground, so
I shall come home to change."</p>

<p>Mr. Ormond, who had not been paying much attention
to the conversation, now laid aside the newspaper
he had been reading, at the same time remarking,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I see that the <i>Arcadia</i> left the docks in London
yesterday bound for Australia, so I suppose by this
time Mr. William Cole has begun his first experience
of being 'rocked in the cradle of the deep.'"</p>

<p>"Was the <i>Arcadia</i> the ship he was going out
on?" asked Ida.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied her father; "that was the one in
which he had booked his passage."</p>

<p>"'Old King Cole was a merry old soul,'" chanted
Guy, with his mouth half full of toast and butter.
"I wish he hadn't gone. I'm sure we shan't ever
have such a nice man again."</p>

<p>"He was a civil, sharp young fellow," said Mr.
Ormond. "I suppose he hopes to do better in the
Colonies than by staying on in the old country. Well,
it's very possible he may get on. He's a handy sort
of chap, and can turn his hand to all kinds of jobs."</p>

<p>William Cole, the subject of these remarks, had,
until about a week previous to the commencement
of this story, been gardener and man-of-all-work
at the Pines. Being easy-going, and clever with
his hands, he had been a great favourite with the
children. Whether it was to clean a bicycle, splice
the broken joint of a fishing-rod, blow birds' eggs,
or cut the fork of a catapult, William was always
the man to whom to apply; and he never failed
in the performance of these services to win the
entire satisfaction of his youthful admirers.</p>

<p>"I am sorry he's gone," said Ida. "He was always
so polite, and never grumbled when you asked him to
run an errand."</p>

<p>"It's time we were off," exclaimed Brian, glancing
at the clock.&mdash;"Will you excuse me, aunt? I've got
to find my books."</p>

<p>The children rose from the table, and rushed out
into the hall, where a fresh dispute, though of a
friendly nature, occurred between Ida and Guy with
regard to the ownership of a certain book-strap.
There was a good deal of racing up and down stairs,
and at length the bang of the front door proclaimed
the fact that they had all started&mdash;the boys for the
big school in the centre of the town, and the girls for
one a little nearer home.</p>

<p>"It seems strange that both Ida and Elsie should
have had such queer fancies last night," said Mrs.
Ormond to her husband as they remained seated
together at the breakfast table.</p>

<p>"What was it? I didn't quite catch what they
were saying."</p>

<p>"Why, Elsie says she was awakened by hearing
the grindstone turning in the tool-house. She went
down to see if it was Brian sharpening his chisels,
but she got frightened, so returned and woke Ida.
Then Ida declares that, when she went across to the
boys' room to see if they were awake, Bob was in the
house, and came running up the stairs to her; but
Jane says that, when they came down this morning,
Bob was outside in his kennel."</p>

<p>"I expect Ida was more than half asleep," answered
her father, "and thought she saw the dog. I know
I've still gone on dreaming when I've been roused up
suddenly out of a sound sleep. What Elsie heard
was, no doubt, the wind."</p>

<p>"But she says there was a light in the tool-house."</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing but the reflection of the moonlight
on the glass, you may depend. If there had been
any one about who had no business there, the dog
would have barked."</p>

<p>The boys were rather late in getting back to
dinner, and when they arrived they were in a
hurry to get the meal over and be off again. Brian
had to change and walk to the football ground, while
Guy intended to go with him and watch the game.</p>

<p>"Whom is the match against?" asked Mrs. Ormond.</p>

<p>"Against Newford College, mother," was the reply.
"We ought to lick 'em this time. We've got a ripping
strong team."</p>

<p>"I expect you'll come back with that nice red and
white shirt of yours mud all over, Brian," said Ida.</p>

<p>"Oh, that doesn't matter so long as we win,"
answered her cousin.</p>

<p>"If the ladies will excuse it, I think I'd better
serve you first, Brian," said Mr. Ormond, as the cover
was removed, disclosing a couple of roast fowls.
"Then you'll have time to get into your war paint.&mdash;My
dear," the speaker continued, addressing his
wife, "I wish I could have the proper poultry-carver
instead of this big knife."</p>

<p>"Isn't it laid?" inquired Mrs. Ormond.&mdash;"Jane, you
should have put the smaller carving-knife."</p>

<p>"Please, 'm," answered the maid. "I meant to do
so, but I can't find it."</p>

<p>"Can't find it! Doesn't Sarah know where it is?"</p>

<p>"No, ma'am; she says she remembers it being
brought in the last time it was sent out to be
cleaned, but we can't find it now. We turned the
cupboard out just before dinner-time."</p>

<p>"Are you sure that Henry hasn't had it to clean,
and left it behind in the tool-house when he brought
in the other knives?"</p>

<p>"Yes, 'm; we've looked there."</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind," said the master of the house;
"I'll make this knife do now; you'll find the other
somewhere."</p>

<p>"But there's no reason why it should have been
lost," replied Mrs. Ormond. "I can't imagine where
it's gone to."</p>

<p>"I say," cried Guy, "perhaps it was the poultry-carver
that Elsie's ghost was grinding last night!
Ha! ha! That's where it went!"</p>

<p>"I never said it was a ghost, you stupid," answered
Elsie, a good bit nettled.</p>

<p>"Well, some one said it was."</p>

<p>"You said so yourself, Guy; and it's not fair to
put it off on me."</p>

<p>"You were the person who heard it; and so, if
it was a ghost, it was your ghost."</p>

<p>"It <i>isn't</i> my ghost!" cried Elsie, thumping the
table, and getting very red. "It isn't a ghost at
all, so shut up, Guy."</p>

<p>"How d'you know it wasn't a ghost? If you
didn't see what it was, it might as well be a ghost
as anything else."</p>

<p>"Come now," interrupted Mrs. Ormond; "I think
we discussed this matter quite enough at breakfast,
so now you'd better let it rest. Your father thinks
that it was nothing but the wind whistling through
some crack that Elsie mistook for the noise of the
stone."</p>

<p>"But, mother&mdash;" began the little girl.</p>

<p>"Never mind, Elsie," interrupted Mrs. Ormond;
"we won't talk about it any more just now. There's
nothing to be ashamed of in mistaking one sound for
another, especially when you wake up in the middle
of the night, and everything seems strange."</p>

<p>Elsie subsided, but she was far from satisfied,
especially as Guy covertly pulled a face at her
across the table. She ate her dinner in silence,
and as soon as the meal was over left the room
and went outside in a pet. As the tool-house had
been uppermost in her mind lately, she naturally
found her way there, and sat down on an old
hamper to think. Though sensitive, she was a
courageous child, and she did not like being made fun
of, especially when the taunt implied that she had
been frightened at nothing.</p>

<p>There before her stood the grindstone, looking
exactly the same as it had always done. The girl
rose, walked over to it, and put her foot on the
treadle.</p>

<p>"Squeak! squeak!" Yes, that was exactly the
noise she had heard in the night, coupled with the
grate of the stone against the hard metal. She felt
more than ever sure that she had not been mistaken.</p>

<p>At that moment the door opened, and Brian appeared.
In his short blue knickers, and with the
gaily coloured shirt showing beneath his coat, he
looked what he was&mdash;a thoroughly manly boy. He
and Elsie were always the best of good comrades, and
the latter was always ready to tell Brian her troubles,
feeling sure of a sympathetic hearing.</p>

<p>"Are my football boots out here?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, they're over there. And, I say, Bri, I <i>did</i>
hear the grindstone turning last night, and it's too
bad of them to say I didn't."</p>

<p>"Well, if you did, you did," answered Brian consolingly.
"There's no reason to fret yourself about
such a trifle."</p>

<p>"But Guy tries to make out I was frightened at
nothing, and I wasn't."</p>

<p>"Not you," grunted Brian, dragging on his boots.
"You're a good plucked un, I know."</p>

<p>"D'you really think so?" answered Elsie, much
relieved. "Bri, you're a brick. I hope you'll kick
ten goals this afternoon."</p>

<p>"I shall be content if I kick two," answered the
boy, stamping his feet on the flagstones to settle them
into his stiff boots. As he went out he paused for
a moment to look at the grindstone. On the wooden
framework were some dark spots; he examined them
more closely, and scratched one with his nail.</p>

<p>"Humph!&mdash;candle-grease!" he muttered.</p>

<p class="noindent">ullo! What d'you want?"</p></div>

<p><img class="left" src="images/img027.jpg" width="90" alt="BOTTLE" />"Come here a minute."</p>

<p>In three days the incident of the
grindstone had been almost forgotten,
and Elsie was no longer troubled by
any more of Guy's chaff on the subject of her night
alarm. At the present moment she was standing in
her father's library, and had called to her cousin, who
happened to be passing outside in the passage.</p>

<p>"Well, what d'you want?" he repeated as he
entered the room.</p>

<p>"Look!" said Elsie, pointing with her finger; "only
two more days, and it'll be time to open <i>that</i>. Aren't
you longing to know what's inside?"</p>

<p>The object in question stood stowed away in a
dark corner of the room, and the children all knew
its history. It was an oak box or small chest, dark
with age and strongly bound with bands of iron;
the panels were ornamented with rough carvings of
dragons and other curious beasts, and where the iron
clamps met they were secured with good-sized padlocks.</p>

</div>

<p>This box had stood in its present position ever
since the children could remember, and, indeed, it
had been there before even Ida, the eldest of the
three, was born. It had been left to Mr. Ormond
by an eccentric old relative, who had given special
instructions in his will that the chest should not
be opened for twenty years after the date of his
death. The children were never tired of speculating
as to what would be found in "Uncle Roger's Box,"
as it was called; and of late their interest in the
legacy had steadily increased as the time drew near
when the riddle would at last be answered.</p>

<p>"Father says he is going to open it on Thursday
morning," continued Elsie. "November the third;
that's the exact date. I say, Brian, what d'you
think's inside?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know," answered the boy, laughing.
"Old clothes, perhaps."</p>

<p>"Oh, no; it's sure to be something valuable. Just
fancy&mdash;it hasn't been opened for twenty years!
T-w-e-n-t-y years! That's twice as long as the
whole of my life!"</p>

<p>"Then," said Brian, who was good at mental arithmetic,
"it's been shut up for 7,300 days, all but two."</p>

<p>"And on Thursday morning it's to be opened!"
cried Elsie, dancing round the room. "I'm simply
dying to know what's inside. I asked Sarah once
what she thought it would be, and she said she
believed it must be money. I dreamt once that I
came down and saw it open, and that it was full of
the most lovely jewellery&mdash;chains, and rings, and
bracelets, with the most beautiful precious stones set
in them, all colours of the rainbow!"</p>

<p>"Good-night! Why didn't you collar a few? You
might have grabbed a handful, and given some to me."</p>

<p>"I was just going to, when I woke up," answered
Elsie. "That's always the way in dreams."</p>

<p>"I know," replied Brian, laughing. "I've dreamt
I was turned loose in a confectioner's shop, and I
could have anything I liked; and just when I was
going to start on a plate of cheesecakes, Jane came
hammering at the door, saying it was time to get
up. It's a queer old thing," he continued, alluding
to the box. "Let's have a look at the gentleman."</p>

<p>"It's pretty heavy," he continued, as he lifted
the box out into the light of the window; "but
that may be the weight of the wood and iron. I'm
afraid it isn't full of gold, Elsie; if it were, I shouldn't
be able to move it at all."</p>

<p>"Look!" cried the little girl. "The locks can't
be opened because they are sealed. That thing like
one of the chessmen with a leopard standing on top
putting his tongue out was Uncle Roger's crest. He
did that himself just before he died."</p>

<p>The front of each of the padlocks was ornamented
with a big circular lump of dark blue sealing-wax,
on which the impression of the old gentleman's seal
was distinctly visible. While these remained unbroken
it was impossible to put a key into either
of the locks.</p>

<p>"I suppose he did that to make sure that no one
should open the box before the proper time?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Elsie. "You see, even if a
person had keys which would fit the locks, he
couldn't use them unless he first broke the seals;
and no one would do that, because it would show
that the box had been meddled with."</p>

<p>"But supposing you got some more blue wax of the
same colour&mdash;" began Brian. "But, no; of course
you'd want the seal. What became of it, d'you
know?"</p>

<p>"Father's got it. He keeps it locked up in one
of the drawers of the big safe at his office. He
showed it to us once. It's on the end of one of
those chains that old gentlemen used to wear hanging
down under their waistcoats."</p>

<p>At this point the conversation was interrupted
by the entrance of Guy and Ida, who had just returned
from a walk.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" cried the former. "What are you two
doing with Uncle Roger's box?"</p>

<p>"Only looking at it," answered Brian.</p>

<p>"What a crank the old chap must have been!"
continued Guy. "Why didn't he leave it in his will
to be opened at once?"</p>

<p>"I've heard father say that he was always doing
queer things," remarked Ida. "Long after his wife
died he wouldn't eat his meals unless her place was
laid for her opposite to him at table, where she used
to sit. For the last five years of his life they say
he stayed in the house, and never put his foot outside
the door."</p>

<p>"Silly old chump!" remarked Guy. "I wonder
if there really is anything in this old box of his.
Look here; I'll turn it up, and you listen and tell
me if you hear anything move inside."</p>

<p>"O Guy, don't! You may break something!"
exclaimed his sister.</p>

<p>"Not I. I'll do it gently. Now listen." Slowly
and cautiously he turned the box on end, but its
contents did not appear to move.</p>

<p>"I believe the blessed thing's empty!" cried the
boy.</p>

<p>"I fancied I heard something sort of trickle about
inside," said Elsie.</p>

<p>"Oh, you're always fancying something," said her
brother. "You'll say the grindstone's in there next."</p>

<p>"I thought I heard something too," exclaimed
Brian. "But it was only a very slight sound, such
as a bit of loose wood might make&mdash;a chip, perhaps,
from off the inside of the lid."</p>

<p>Guy lowered the box, and turned it up again.
"I do hear something," he admitted. "It's a bit
of wood, I expect. What a sell! I'm certain the
box is empty."</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense; you can't tell," answered Ida. "It
may be quite full of something, and so tightly packed
that the contents are wedged together, and can't shake
about when you move the box. Uncle Roger would
never have taken the trouble to seal the locks, and
leave those instructions in his will, if it were just an
empty box."</p>

<p>"Well, here goes," said Brian. "I'm going to put
it back in its place again." And with these words
he lifted the chest in his strong arms, and returned
it to its old corner. Guy remained for a moment
balancing himself on one foot.</p>

<p>"Let me see," he said; "what was it I meant to
do? Oh, I know! Mend the ring in Bob's collar.
He's always getting loose. First I must get the
tweezers."</p>

<p>He ran off at once to find the tool, but on entering
the kitchen was at once pounced upon by the cook.
Sarah had been at the Pines for many years, and the
young Ormonds had grown to regard her as quite
one of the family.</p>

<p>"Now, Master Guy," she began, "what business
had you got to go and take all my methylated
spirit?"</p>

<p>"I haven't touched it," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Yes, you have, now. You've been and taken it
for that there model steam engine of yours. Why
didn't you come and ask if you might have some?"</p>

<p>"I tell you I <i>haven't</i> had any," persisted the boy.</p>

<p>"Now, Master Guy, you're telling fibs. The bottle
was half full, or nearly so, last week; and when I
come to it this afternoon there wasn't a drop left,
and too late to send down into town and get any."</p>

<p>"Look here, Sarah; you can say what you like,
but I haven't touched your silly old bottle, so there!
Jane must have taken the spirit, or else you used it
yourself."</p>

<p>The boy found the tweezers, and ran out into
the yard. But Sarah was still unconvinced. She
had found her remaining stock of methylated spirit
entirely vanished; and as Guy had been known, on
one or two previous occasions, to borrow the bottle
and help himself to its contents when fuel was
required for his model steam engine, she naturally
supposed him to be the culprit in the present
instance.</p>

<p>Later on, when the family were assembled at
the tea-table, Mrs. Ormond herself referred to the
matter.</p>

<p>"Guy," she said, "are you sure you haven't taken
cook's methylated spirit?"</p>

<p>"Quite sure, mother."</p>

<p>"I should be sorry to think that you weren't
telling me the truth about such a small matter,
but I must say it does seem very strange. Sarah
goes and finds the bottle standing uncorked and
empty, and I know myself that there was some
spirit in it a few days ago."</p>

<p>"Perhaps if the cork wasn't in the bottle the spirit
had evaporated," suggested Elsie.</p>

<p>"I don't think it would do that," replied her
mother, laughing. "I'm rather inclined to think
that it evaporated into the lamp of somebody's
steam engine."</p>

<p>"No, it didn't!" cried Guy. "Look here, mother;
you might as well believe a fellow when he tells
you the truth."</p>

<p>"Well, if you tell me you didn't take it," replied
Mrs. Ormond, "I must believe you. All I can say
is, it's very strange."</p>

<p>The meal over, the boys and girls retired to the
breakfast-room; and there, seated at the usual places
round the table, they began to prepare their work for
the following day.</p>

<p>"Guy," said Ida suddenly, "are you <i>sure</i> you were
telling the truth about that methylated spirit?"</p>

<p>"Of course I was! D'you think I'd lie?"</p>

<p>"You <i>do</i> tell crams sometimes," put in Elsie, who
was not going to see her brother pose as an angel
of light without having a word to say.</p>

<p>"Shut up, Elsie! I tell you I haven't been
near the bottle. It's weeks since I last worked
the engine.&mdash;Isn't it, Brian?"</p>

<p>Brian looked up from his book. "Yes," he answered.
"It's a month, I should say. There was
something wrong with the cylinder, and Cole put
it right."</p>

<p>"There, I told you so!" retorted Guy. "Now,
perhaps you'll believe what I say."</p>

<p>For some time no one spoke. Elsie finished one
of her lessons, and sat back in her chair for a
moment's rest.</p>

<p>"I say," she murmured, "suppose Uncle Roger's
box was full of bank-notes, d'you suppose father
would let us have a pony? I think I should ask
him to buy one."</p>

<p>Guy and Ida both looked up from their books.</p>

<p>"Get away!" cried the boy. "What rot! I
wouldn't mind offering to pay you a shilling for
every bank-note that's found in that stupid old
chest. But, I say," he added, "fancy having a
real live pony! It would be ripping!"</p>

<h3>THE BOX OPENED.</h3>

<div><img class="left" src="images/img038a.jpg" height="70" alt="I" title="" />
<p class="noindent">t seemed as if Thursday
would never
come. The four children
were longing to
know what was inside
the box. Even Guy
was inclined to abandon
his idea that it
was empty, and Elsie
had quite made up her
mind that it contained something
wonderful. The excitement increased as the
time drew nearer when the big blue seals would be
broken, and the wonder seemed to be how any one
could have waited twenty years for this to take
place.</p></div>

<p><img class="left" src="images/img038.jpg" width="200" alt="THE FAMILY" />On Wednesday, when the family were gathered at
dinner, Mrs. Ormond made a suggestion which was
not at first received with unanimous approval.</p>

<p>"As all you children are anxious to see the box
opened," she said, "I think instead of its being done
at breakfast time to-morrow, it had better be postponed
till after tea."</p>

<p>"O mother!" protested Guy and Elsie in the same
breath. "What d'you want to do that for?"</p>

<p>"It's always a rush to get you started for school in
the morning," was the answer. "If there's anything
to hinder you, you're sure to be late. Considering
that the box has been waiting to be opened for so
many years, I'm sure a matter of a few hours can't
make any difference."</p>

<p>"Oh yes; we'll wait till after tea," said Ida, "and
then we shall have plenty of time for a grand opening
ceremony."</p>

<p>With some reluctance Guy and Elsie agreed to this
new arrangement. To them an extra ten hours or so
seemed a very long time. The boy sat silent for
a while, making a kind of switchback with his
napkin-ring and the bread-knife.</p>

<p>"Mother," he said at length, "did you ever find the
carver that was lost?"</p>

<p>"No; I'm sorry to say I haven't," was the reply.
"We've searched and searched, but we can't find it
anywhere."</p>

<p>"That's strange," remarked Mr. Ormond from his
end of the table. "Does Harry know anything about
it?" he added, alluding to a boy who had come in as
a makeshift to clean knives and boots since the
departure of William Cole.</p>

<p>"No; I spoke to him at once, and made him search
the tool-house, but he couldn't find the knife. He
says he never remembers having seen it, which I
believe is true, for I don't think he's had it to clean
since he's been here."</p>

<p>"It ought to be somewhere," remarked Mr. Ormond.
"The lad's perfectly honest, I should say, and can't
have walked off with it. At the same time, a carving-knife
isn't a thing that disappears into thin air."</p>

<p>"Oh, I dare say we shall find it before long," was
the answer. "Sometimes things do slip away in the
most unaccountable manner, and you never discover
where they are gone until perhaps you come across
them quite by accident&mdash;often when you are looking
for something else."</p>

<p>Elsie could hardly go to sleep that night for thinking
of what was going to happen on the morrow. It
would be nice, she imagined, to have a mysterious box
like that to open every day of the year, and so ensure
a constant succession of fresh surprises. Once more
the chest was the subject of her dreams; and this
time, instead of being found full of treasure, it simply
would not open at all. Brian, Guy, and her father
were all trying to force up the lid, but the iron bands
held it firm. The only tool they had with which to
work was the poultry-carver, and this bent up like
a strip of paper.</p>

<p>"Oh, bother!" cried Elsie, and stamped her foot.
With that the whole room seemed to rock and totter,
and Ida's voice was heard complaining in sleepy tones,
"I wish you wouldn't kick me and shout 'bother.'
Do lie still!"</p>

<p>At length Thursday evening arrived. Blinds were
lowered, curtains drawn, and lamps lighted. At the
tea-table, as might be imagined, there was but one
topic of conversation.</p>

<p>"Well, Brian," said Mr. Ormond, "what'll you
give me for what's inside the box?"</p>

<p>"I should want to see first what it is, uncle."</p>

<p>"Very likely; but I want to know what offer you
are inclined to make before it is opened. Come now&mdash;a
speculation."</p>

<p>Brian laughed, and Elsie, who seemed unable to sit
still on her chair, burst out with&mdash;"Father, if it is
full of bank-notes, will you buy us a pony?"</p>

<p>"I think I must take an example from Brian, and
be cautious," answered her father, laughing. "There
are bank-notes and bank-notes. They might each be
worth five pounds or five hundred; and between the
two there is a considerable difference."</p>

<p>"If it's full of five-pound notes, would you buy
us a pony?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;yes. I think I may safely say I would,"
answered Mr. Ormond, with another laugh. "But,"
he added, "I'm afraid, Elsie, that I shan't be called
upon to fulfil my promise."</p>

<p>Elsie clapped her hands. Her mother smiled, and
paused in the act of raising the silver teapot.</p>

<p>"Come, now," she remarked; "suppose each of you
say in turn what you think will be found inside this
wonderful box that has been shut up for twenty years."</p>

<p>"Father, you begin," said Ida&mdash;"you guess first."</p>

<p>"I'm sure I can't form any idea," was the answer.
"What does your mother say?"</p>

<p>"I'll guess it's full of old letters and papers," was
the reply.</p>

<p>"O mother, how uninteresting!" exclaimed Ida.
"I'll say it's jewellery and silver plate."</p>

<p>"I'll say a bag of money!" cried Brian.</p>

<p>"I'll say old clothes!" shouted Guy. "What d'you
say, Elsie?"</p>

<p>"A pony&mdash;no, I mean bank-notes," was the prompt
reply, received with a fresh outburst of merriment.</p>

<p>"Well, come along," said Mr. Ormond, rising from
the table. "Come along, and we'll see which of you
has guessed nearest the truth."</p>

<p>The children all sprang from their chairs.</p>

<p>"A procession! a procession!" cried Ida. And one
was immediately formed. Mr. Ormond went first,
carrying the lamp; Guy followed, beating a tray to
represent a drum; Ida, Elsie, and Brian improvised
musical instruments out of the fire-irons, and Mrs.
Ormond brought up the rear.</p>

<p>"Now," said Mr. Ormond, when the library was
reached and the band ceased its triumphal march,
"suppose you strong young men lift the box out into
the middle of the room, and then we'll commence
operations."</p>

<p>Guy and Brian soon had the chest in the position
indicated; the lamp was put close by on an adjoining
table, and boys and girls gathered round, one and all
on the tip-toe of eager expectation.</p>

<p>"The first thing will be to get these seals off the
padlocks," said Mr. Ormond. "Now, how are we
going to do that? Old Uncle Roger certainly wasn't
sparing of his wax."</p>

<p>"I've got an old chisel that'll do it!" cried Brian.
"I'll fetch it, if you'll wait half a minute."</p>

<p>"Well, make haste!" cried Guy impatiently.</p>

<p>"It seems almost a shame to break the seals," said
Ida, stooping to examine them. "The impression is
so clear that I can read the words of the motto."</p>

<p>"Oh, bother the seals!" said her brother. "We
can't see what's inside the box until they are broken."</p>

<p>A moment later Brian came bounding back with
his chisel. Mr. Ormond took the tool, and soon
chipped the wax away from the face of the locks.</p>

<p>"Now," he remarked, with a smile, "what should
you say if we found I'd lost the keys?"</p>

<p>"Say!" cried Guy. "Oh, I should say, Burst it
open somehow. Get the wood-axe, or the coal-hammer."</p>

<p>"I don't think there'll be any need for such
extreme measures," answered his father. "Go to
the top drawer on the left-hand side of that writing-table,
and in it you'll find two keys on a steel ring."</p>

<p>The keys were produced, the padlocks unfastened
and removed. The supreme moment had arrived,
and the children crowded round holding their breath.</p>

<p>"Now then, children," said Mr. Ormond, preparing
to raise the lid. "Are you all quite ready? Very
well, then. One&mdash;two&mdash;three!"</p>

<p>There was a moment of astonished silence as the
whole company bent over the opened chest. With a
sort of gasp, Ida broke the spell. "<i>Empty!</i>" she cried.</p>

<p>It was perfectly true; the box was as empty as
Mother Hubbard's famous cupboard.</p>

<p>"What a sell!" cried Guy, and burst out laughing.
The disappointment was almost too much for Elsie;
the tears came into her eyes, and her lips trembled.</p>

<p>"Cheer up, little woman!" said her father kindly.
"It might have been worse. D'you remember the
story in the 'Arabian Nights' of the fisherman who
dragged a brass bottle out of the sea, and when he
had broken the seals and taken out the stopper
a great genie rushed forth in a cloud of smoke,
telling the unfortunate man to choose what death
he would die? Suppose, now, the same sort of
creature came out of this box."</p>

<p>"I do call it a lot too bad!" exclaimed Ida. "D'you
think Uncle Roger really did it on purpose, and left
you only an empty box?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know," replied her father. "It
seems like it. Perhaps he did it for a joke."</p>

<p>"A very silly sort of joke, then," continued the
girl snappishly, "to make people keep a stupid old box
for twenty years, when it was empty all the time."</p>

<p>"D'you think, uncle," began Brian, "that there was
something in it once, but that it's been stolen?"</p>

<p>"That's impossible," was the answer. "No one
could open the box without breaking the seals on the
padlocks, and there you saw them just now intact,
as they have always been. Supposing a thief had
broken them, he couldn't have made fresh ones unless
he had had the old man's seal, which I keep locked
up in one of the drawers of my safe at the office."</p>

<p>"I suppose it would be impossible to break into
the box through the bottom or one of the sides?"
said the boy thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Oh yes," answered Guy. "You couldn't possibly
do that. It's made of solid oak, and see how strongly
it's bound with iron. If you wanted to break into it
at all, you'd have to smash it all up with an axe or
sledge-hammer."</p>

<p>"I can't believe that anything has been stolen,"
said Mr. Ormond. "No; I think old Uncle Roger
must have done it as a queer sort of joke. He was
a strange old fellow."</p>

<p>"Well, it's a horrid, mean thing to do," cried Elsie,
still half inclined to give way to tears. "It's perfectly
hateful. Now we shall never have the pony."</p>

<p>The group continued to linger round the open box,
as if still hoping that some treasure might be found.</p>

<p>"I think you'd better all come back into the warm
room," said Mrs. Ormond. "It's very cold here.&mdash;Brian,
will you put the box back in its old place?
Some one may fall over it in the dark."</p>

<p>The boy prepared to do as he was asked.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" he exclaimed. "There is something in
the old thing, after all."</p>

<p>"What?" cried all three of his cousins at once.</p>

<p>Brian laughed, and held up something between his
finger and thumb. "A cork!" he answered.</p>

<p class="noindent">cork?" cried Ida. "Let me see it."</p></div>

<p>Brian handed over the small object which
he had seen lying in a corner of the empty
box. It was an ordinary
cork, such as would
fit a good-sized medicine
bottle.</p>

<div><img class="figleft" src="images/img048.jpg" height="180" alt="SHIPWRECK" /></div>

<p>"That's what we must
have heard the other
day rolling about when
we turned the chest up on its end," said Guy.</p>

<p>"What's the good of it? Throw it away!" cried
Elsie, who could not get the bank-notes out of her
mind.</p>

<p>"I wonder how it can have got there!" said Guy,
as the family prepared to move back into the warmer
room. "What could be the good of locking up and
sealing a cork in an iron-bound box for twenty
years?"</p>

<p>"I don't suppose it was put there on purpose,"
answered his father. "It dropped in by mistake."</p>

<p>"Oh, come on! Let's get to our lessons," said Ida.
"I'm sick of that stupid box."</p>

<p>At that moment Brian, who had stayed behind to
put the chest back in its place, appeared in the
room.</p>

<p>"Uncle," he said, "this cork has got a little round
label on the top, with the name of a chemist on it&mdash;'Greenworthy.'"</p>

<p>Mr. Ormond took the cork, looked at it, held it
nearer the lamp, and looked at it again.</p>

<p>"This is curious," he muttered.</p>

<p>"What's curious, father?" asked Elsie.</p>

<p>"Why, this cork has Greenworthy's name on it,
and Greenworthy hasn't been in business for more
than ten years at the outside, so how can one of his
corks come to be inside a box that has been shut for
twenty?"</p>

<p>"Then the box has been opened," said Brian.</p>

<p>Mr. Ormond seemed to doubt this. "One of you
children must have dropped the cork in just now,"
he said. "Are you sure you didn't, Brian?"</p>

<p>"Quite sure, uncle," answered the boy.</p>

<p>"And I'm sure neither of us did," added each of
his cousins.</p>

<p>"Perhaps there's a knot-hole in the box through
which the cork might have been poked some time,"
suggested Elsie.</p>

<p>"I don't think there is," said Guy, moving towards
the door. "But I'll soon see."</p>

<p>He returned a few moments later, but only to
report that there was not the smallest crack or hole
in the wood through which a pin could be dropped.</p>

<p>"It's certainly very funny," said Mr. Ormond.
"The cork must have fallen out of some one's pocket
after we'd opened the box. I may have dropped
it in myself."</p>

<p>"But we heard it rolling about in the box some
time ago," remarked Elsie.</p>

<p>"Well, it's a mystery," answered her father,
laughing&mdash;"one which I can't explain."</p>

<p>The children prepared to retire to the breakfast-room
and begin their day's lessons. Brian, however,
had still one more question to ask.</p>

<p>"Uncle," he said, "supposing a thief had opened
that box, wouldn't it be possible for him to imitate
the seals?"</p>

<p>"Of course it would be possible to get a duplicate
die made," was the answer. "But I'll tell you why
I feel sure that in this case the locks have not been
tampered with. Uncle Roger's seal came into my
possession directly after his death, and has been in
my safe ever since. In one place it was slightly
damaged. There was a peculiar cut or scratch on
the metal face, and I noticed that this cut was
visible in the impression on the seals we broke just
now. That could not have been imitated, and I'm
quite convinced in my own mind that the box has
not been opened."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr class="minimal" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By Saturday the keen edge of the disappointment
had somewhat worn off, though Elsie had hardly
recovered her accustomed spirits, and still grieved
for the pony which she had quite made up her
mind was to have been a black one, with white
socks, and a white star on its forehead. Perhaps
the boys felt the failure of their hopes and expectations
less than the girl, from the fact that they
had something on hand just then which occupied a
considerable amount of their attention, and a good
portion of their spare time.</p>

<p>Brian's great hobby was ship-building, and the
fact that there was a fish-pond in the garden at
the Pines enabled him to give each fresh model a
practical test as soon as it was ready to be launched.
He had constructed vessels of all descriptions&mdash;ships
that sailed, and ships that didn't; gunboats which
mounted a brass cannon, and peaceful merchant
traders which carried cargoes of earth and stones
across the water from one shore to another.</p>

<p>Now he had upon the stocks a vessel of an altogether
novel design, and this latest addition to his
miniature navy had cost him a great many hours of
work and the exercise of no small amount of patience
before it could be pronounced ready for use. It was
said to be a "torpedo-boat destroyer," and was constructed
out of the hull of an old tin boat. Her
engines had once formed the motive power of a
clockwork locomotive, but they had now been adapted
to marine requirements, and made to turn a small
screw.</p>

<p>With the determination to be up to date, Brian
had resolved to have no woodwork about this war
vessel. With considerable labour he had cut decks,
funnels, and other fittings out of tin; to fix these in
place it had been necessary to acquire the art of
using a soldering-iron, and this he had done, though
at the price of at least one rather bad burn and a
blistered finger.</p>

<p>Evening after evening, when lessons were done,
he had devoted his spare time to work on his model,
fixing the engines, soldering down the decks, and
putting in ballast, so as to balance the boat and
keep her on an even keel. At length the work was
finished; the <i>Fury</i>, as she was called, was painted
all over an orthodox black, and when given a trial
trip in the bath, ran from end to end in a manner
which was quite satisfactory. Brian's next wish was
to prove that the little vessel was equal to a trip
across the fish-pond.</p>

<p>Saturday afternoon was fixed upon for the experiment,
and soon after dinner Guy, Elsie, and their
cousin assembled at the water-side, Ida having gone
out with a friend. The pond was circular in shape,
with a brick bottom, and was perhaps about thirty
feet in diameter. It was shallow near the shore, and
in one or two places were large pots in which water-lilies
were planted, these forming dangerous reefs on
which an unskilful captain of a model craft might
well run his vessel aground. Brian wound up the
engines of the <i>Fury</i>, keeping his finger on the screw
to prevent it starting off with a whiz; then, adjusting
the rudder, he lowered the "destroyer" into
the water.</p>

<p>"Doesn't she look fine?" cried Guy, as the little
vessel started off in good style. "Just like a real
little steamer. Wouldn't it be fun if we could have
two fleets, and make them fight? Hullo! She's
changing her course."</p>

<p>The last remark was occasioned by the small craft
bearing round in a curve, and making for the shore
in another direction.</p>

<p>"It's the rudder," said Brian. "It doesn't work
right. Give me a bit of string, and I'll see if I can't
fix it properly this time."</p>

<p>After some little delay, the <i>Fury</i> was ready for
another voyage. In moving round the pond Elsie
had found a broken lead soldier lying on the brick-work,
a relic of some bygone naval engagement.</p>

<p>"Here!" she said; "let me put this man on board."</p>

<p>Brian seldom refused any of Elsie's requests.</p>

<p>"All right," he said; "put him on the bridge."</p>

<p>The lead soldier was propped up against the little
wire railing. "There!" cried Elsie; "that's William
Cole going out to Australia."</p>

<p>Once more the little vessel was placed in the
water, and her propeller allowed to revolve. Away
she went in grand style, straight across the pond,
and leaving quite a miniature wake in her stern.</p>

<p>"Oh, bother!" muttered Brian, as again the straight
course became a curve. "There she goes! That
rudder <i>will</i> work round."</p>

<p>"Hullo!" exclaimed Guy. "Look out! She'll be
wrecked in a minute!"</p>

<p>The "destroyer" was now heading for one of the
submerged pots; a moment later she struck, and
remained with her screw still working, but with her
bow entangled in a bunch of weed.</p>

<p>"I shall have to court-martial the captain for
running his ship ashore," said Brian.</p>

<p>"Poor William!" cried Elsie; "fancy being shipwrecked
on his first voyage!"</p>

<p>For some minutes the children stood gazing idly
at the disabled craft; her engines had stopped working,
and it was evident that she would have to be
towed into port.</p>

<p>"We must get a long stick&mdash;a fishing-rod, or something
of that kind," said Guy. "Hullo!" he added.
"Look, Brian! I believe she's sinking."</p>

<p>It was only too true; the "destroyer" was slowly
settling down, stern foremost.</p>

<p>"Oh, do get it!" cried Elsie; but the wreck was
well out of reach&mdash;at least ten feet from the shore.
For a minute the spectators stood hesitating, undecided
what to do; then the vessel gave a lurch,
her bows slipped from the edge of the flower-pot,
and down she went.</p>

<p>"O Brian, I am so sorry!" exclaimed Elsie.
"You've taken so much trouble to make it, and
poor William's drowned!"</p>

<p>Brian laughed. "Oh, we can get her out again,"
he said. "I think she must have been leaking where
the propeller shaft goes through her stern."</p>

<p>If it had been summer one of the boys would
probably have rolled up his trousers and waded into
the water to recover the boat. As it was, they had
to improvise some form of drag.</p>

<p>"We must get that big rake," said Brian. "We
can lash it to one of those clothes-props, and then
we shall be able to reach her and haul her out."</p>

<p>The rake was found, and bound with stout cord
to the clothes-prop, and the process of "salving" the
wrecked steamer commenced.</p>

<p>"I must mind and not damage her with these
iron spikes," said Brian, carefully thrusting out the
head of the rake and lowering it into the water.</p>

<p>"Hullo! I've got something," he remarked an
instant later, as he hauled in the drag. "But it
isn't the boat. What can it be?"</p>

<p>The prongs of the rake grated on the bricks, and
there, amid dead leaves, rotten twigs, and muddy
sediment, lay something which at first glance might
have been mistaken for a dead fish. Guy stooped
down and picked it up out of the water. For a
moment he gazed at it in utter astonishment.</p>

<p>"Why, it's the missing carving-knife!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p class="noindent">t's that poultry-carver right
enough," repeated Guy&mdash;"the
one the mater said was lost."</p>

<p>His sister and Brian all
crowded round to have a
nearer view of the object in
question.</p>
<div><img class="figleft" src="images/img058.jpg" height="180" alt="GUY" /></div>
<p>"So it is!" cried Elsie.
"How on earth could it have
got into the pond?"</p>

<p>"I suppose some one threw it in," answered her
brother. "It couldn't have walked or flown there
of its own accord."</p>

<p>"But why should any one throw a knife into the
pond? Who could have done such a silly thing?"</p>

<p>"Oh, ask me something easier," laughed Guy. "All
I know is, 'twasn't my doing."</p>

<p>"Let's have a look," said Brian, holding out his
hand. "The point's broken, and the little plated
knob from the end has gone."</p>

<p>He took the knife and examined it more closely.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" he exclaimed. "Look at the blade.
That's queer."</p>

<p>"What? what?" demanded the others.</p>

<p>"Why, something's been done to it; it's as thin
as paper."</p>

<p>The knife blade certainly presented a curious
appearance. Though maintaining its original form
and size, it seemed to have wasted away until it
was scarcely thicker than a sheet of note-paper. It
was probably owing to this fact that the point had
snapped off when it came into contact with the
bricks at the bottom of the pond.</p>

<p>"Perhaps the water has made it go like that,"
suggested Elsie.</p>

<p>"Oh no," answered her cousin. "You can see
where it's rusty. It must have been ground or
rubbed down on a stone."</p>

<p>"But why should any one grind a knife blade as
thin as that?" asked the girl. "If you tried to
cut anything, the blade would bend all up or
break."</p>

<p>"The best thing for us to do will be to take it
indoors and show it to the mater," said Guy. "I
expect she'll be jolly surprised when she hears we
found it in the pond."</p>

<p>"Wait half a minute," answered Brian, who was
always practical. "Let me get my ship out first."</p>

<p>The rake was once more thrust out, and the end
lowered into the water; after two unsuccessful attempts
the whereabouts of the sunken <i>Fury</i> was
discovered, and she was carefully dragged to the
edge of the pond.</p>

<p>"There!" said Brian, as he carefully emptied the
water out of the little craft. "That's where she leaks.
I'll stop that up before we try her again. Now let's
go and find aunt, and show her the knife."</p>

<p>Elsie walked along beside the others in silence;
she was dying to say something, but was afraid to
speak. Brian's statement that the knife blade must
have been reduced by grinding or rubbing on a stone
had at once reminded her of her midnight, or, rather,
early morning adventure. Could it have been this
poultry-carver that the mysterious intruder was
working at when she had awoke and seen the faint
light in the tool-house? She longed to hazard the
suggestion, but Guy and Ida had already made so
much fun of her story that she feared to mention the
subject again lest it should occasion a fresh teasing.</p>

<p>The children found Mr. and Mrs. Ormond in the
hall, just preparing to start out for a walk.</p>

<p>"Mother, we've found the carving-knife!" cried
Guy. "'Twas at the bottom of the pond."</p>

<p>With three people all assisting one another in the
telling, the story did not take long to relate. Mr.
and Mrs. Ormond seemed equally astonished.</p>

<p>"Look, uncle, how thin it is," said Brian. "It
must have been ground down carefully on a stone."</p>

<p>"So I see," was the answer. "It's very extraordinary."</p>

<p>"Most extraordinary," echoed Mrs. Ormond. "Then,
who could have thrown it into the pond?&mdash;Guy, are
you sure you know nothing about it?"</p>

<p>"Quite sure, mother."</p>

<p>"I don't like to doubt the honesty of that boy
Henry," began Mr. Ormond, "but the thought has
just occurred to me that he might, when he was
cleaning the knives, have tried to put an edge on
this one, and ground it too much; then, being afraid
to bring it back to the house, have thrown it into
the pond."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't think that," answered Mrs. Ormond.
"I'm quite sure Henry's honest. I asked him about
the knife, and he said he never remembered having
seen it; in fact, as I said before, I don't think he's
had it to clean since he's been here."</p>

<p>"Besides, if he had wanted to put an edge on it,
he'd never have ground the whole blade thin like
that," added Brian.</p>

<p>"Put it away somewhere," said Mr. Ormond, "and
I'll have a look at it again when I come back."</p>

<p>The little group dispersed. Brian and Guy went
away to mend the boat, while Elsie, left to herself,
wandered out into the yard and entered the tool-house.
There stood the grindstone in its usual place,
looking a very unromantic object indeed; but the
girl viewed it with almost bated breath. She had
quite made up her mind that connected with that
grindstone was a mystery in which the poultry-carver
was somehow concerned. What this secret
was she could not imagine; but the belief grew in
her mind that if she had been able to summon up
sufficient courage to have crossed the yard that night,
and to have peeped round the door of the tool-house,
she might now be able to explain how and why the
poultry-carver had found its way to the bottom of
the pond.</p>

<p>She longed to tell the others what was in her
thoughts, but pride made her hold her tongue. She
did not like being made fun of, and she felt sure
that any reference to what Ida called her "dream"
about the grindstone was certain to be received with
nothing but ridicule by both brother and sister.</p>

<p>In one corner of the tool-house stood Uncle Roger's
iron-bound box, which, since the eventful evening
when it was opened, had been banished from the
library in disgrace, Mr. Ormond wishing to put a
small bookcase in the space which the box had
hitherto occupied.</p>

<p>Elsie tried to lift the lid, but the two padlocks
had been refastened to prevent their being lost.
She sat down on the chest, and began drumming her
feet on the dark oak planks.</p>

<p>"What a disappointment that old box has proved!"
thought the girl. "I wonder if there ever <i>was</i>
anything in it. Father seems to think it couldn't
possibly have been opened, but then how did that
cork with Greenworthy's name on it come to be inside?
I do wish it had been full of money. It would
have been jolly to have had a real pony, and to
have learned to ride."</p>

<p>"If wishes were horses," runs the old proverb,
"then beggars would ride;" and Elsie had to rest
content with a short day-dream, from which she at
length awoke with a little sigh of regret.</p>

<p>An hour or two later, as Guy unstrapped his pile
of school books and flung them down on the breakfast-room
table, he referred to the discovery which
had been made earlier in the day.</p>

<p>"The pater can't understand that carving-knife.
I wonder how in the world it got into the pond!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I wonder too," said Ida, rather suspiciously.
"And I wonder if you, Guy, could explain it if you
chose."</p>

<p>"I explain it!" exclaimed the boy. "What do
you mean?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you know you <i>have</i> done things like that,"
returned his sister calmly. "You smashed a big
flower-pot the other day, and threw the pieces away
into the hedge."</p>

<p>"Look here, Ida," cried Guy, with a great show of
indignation. "You're always accusing me of doing
things, and it's not fair. The other day you tried
to make out I'd taken cook's methylated spirit when
I said I hadn't. What's the good of a fellow telling
the truth if he isn't believed?"</p>

<p>"Shall I tell you what I think about it?" asked
Brian, looking up from the open book before him,
with his finger at the spot where he had left off
reading.</p>

<p>"Yes," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Well, the idea's come into my head that some one
was grinding the knife that night when Elsie woke
up and heard the stone turning."</p>

<p>Elsie clapped her hands with delight; her cousin's
words were exactly what she herself had been longing
to speak.</p>

<p>"That's just what I've been thinking, Brian!" she
cried. "I'm sure that's right."</p>

<p>"What nonsense!" ejaculated Guy. "You never
did hear any one working at the grindstone. It was
a dream."</p>

<p>"I'm not sure about that," answered his cousin.
"When I looked at the grindstone next day there
were spots of candle-grease on the wooden frame."</p>

<p>"What if there were?" interrupted Guy. "Henry
may have taken a light in there late in the afternoon.
Because there were a few spots of grease about,
it doesn't prove that some one was working there
in the middle of the night. Besides, supposing
the knife was ground on our stone at that unearthly
hour, it doesn't explain anything. It doesn't show
what earthly object there could be in making the
blade as thin as possible, and then throwing it into
the pond."</p>

<p>"Oh, of course it doesn't," answered Brian; "but
if you're ever going to get at the explanation of a
thing like that, you must begin at the beginning, and
ravel it out bit by bit. I believe it began that night
when Elsie heard the stone turning, and I shall
continue to think so until I have reason to believe
otherwise."</p>

<p>"Oh, you're talking nonsense!" said Guy, who
could think of no better reply to make. "Now,
let's get on with our work."</p>

<p>It so happened that at the same time the children
were talking over the strange loss and reappearance
of the carving-knife, the subject was also being discussed
in the dining-room.</p>

<p>"If I hadn't been quite sure that Guy was speaking
the truth, I should have set it down as his doing,"
said Mrs. Ormond.</p>

<p>"It's neither of the boys' doing," answered her husband
from behind his newspaper. "I saw that at once."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Why," replied Mr. Ormond, laying down his
paper, and reaching for the knife, which lay on a
side table, "it's a difficult matter to grind a blade
as thin as that. No boy did it; at least that's my
opinion. It was done by a man, and one who knew
what he was about.</p>

<p>"I shall be at the police court on Monday," the
speaker continued after a pause, "and I have a good
mind to ask Evans, the sergeant, to step round and
have a look at it. I'm inclined to think there's
more in this matter than may appear on the surface."</p>

<h3>SAD NEWS.</h3>

<div><img class="left" src="images/img068a.jpg" height="60" alt="D" title="" /></div>
<p class="noindent">ear me!" exclaimed Mr.
Ormond, opening his
morning paper and
glancing at one of the
headings printed in big
black letters. "Heavy
loss of life at sea again; two
vessels in collision, and both
sunk. Why! good gracious!"
he continued; "the <i>Arcadia</i>&mdash;that
was the ship William
Cole sailed on!"</p>

<div><img class="figleft" src="images/img068.jpg" height="220" alt="NEWSPAPER BOY" /></div>

<p>There was a dropping of knives and forks all
round the table, and a general exclamation of dismay.</p>

<p>"O father!" cried Ida. "You don't mean to say
that the <i>Arcadia</i> is lost?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid so," was the reply. "Yes; it says,
'which sailed from London on Friday, October 28th.'
It must be the same boat."</p>

<p>"But perhaps William wasn't drowned," exclaimed
Elsie. "Doesn't it say if any of them were saved?"</p>

<p>"Only fourteen souls from the liner," was the reply.
"Ten of the crew, and four passengers. Their names
are given here, but poor William Cole isn't mentioned."</p>

<p>"How dreadful!" exclaimed Ida. She pushed
away her plate, and the tears started to her eyes.
Elsie, too, leant back in her chair, the corners of her
mouth beginning to turn down.</p>

<p>"She must have sunk very quickly, uncle," said
Brian. "How did it happen?"</p>

<p>"She seems to have come in collision with a sailing
ship named the <i>Cumberland</i>," answered Mr. Ormond.
"'It was in a fog, and during the early hours
of the morning, when all the passengers were below
in their berths. The <i>Arcadia</i> sank almost immediately.
Two boats were filled and lowered, but one
capsized as it touched the water. The survivors were
taken on board the <i>Cumberland</i>, but that vessel was
so badly damaged that it was found impossible to
keep her afloat. Fortunately the rockets she sent up
were seen by a merchant steamer, which took the
<i>Cumberland's</i> crew and the survivors from the <i>Arcadia</i>
on board, and eventually landed them at one of
the Spanish ports. One man on the sailing ship was
killed and another injured by the falling of spars
from aloft, which were brought down by the blow.'"</p>

<p>"But isn't there any hope that William was saved?"
asked Elsie in a choking voice. "Has he really been
drowned?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid so," was the reply. "The names of all
those saved were telegraphed at once by the British
consul."</p>

<p>"I can't think how a big ship like that can possibly
sink so quickly," said Guy.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't wonder at it if you saw the size of
the hole that one vessel can make in another's side,"
answered his father. "It's very sad. Poor William!
If he'd only known what was before him, he'd have
been content to stop in England."</p>

<p>A dark shadow seemed to have fallen on the breakfast
table. The children went on with their meal
in silence. William Cole had always been popular
with them, for reasons which have already been
given. He was a civil-spoken, dapper-looking young
fellow, perhaps not over fond of work, and a little too
ready for a half-hour's gossip, or for spending his
time making the tail of a kite, when he should have
been cleaning the yard or digging in the garden.
But whatever his faults had been, they were for the
time forgotten, and only his better qualities remembered.
Even Guy seemed shocked and subdued by
the terrible news.</p>

<p>"I say," he remarked, as he and Brian walked
along on their way to school, "it's awful to think that
William's drowned! Somehow, I can't believe it's
true. He was such a sharp, lively sort of chap, it
seems almost impossible that he's dead, and that we
shall never see him again. Even now I feel inclined
to shout for him, and ask him to do things, just as if
he were still at work somewhere about the place."</p>

<p>Mr. Ormond, who was a magistrate, had to attend
at the police court that morning, and was rather late
in returning home to dinner.</p>

<p>"By the way," he said, speaking to his wife, "I
mentioned that carving-knife to Evans, our police
sergeant, and asked him to call in when he's passing,
and just have a look at it; so he says he'll be round
some time this evening. I'll see him here in the
dining-room, if he comes when the children are at
their lessons. They needn't know the reason why
he called."</p>

<p>"You don't suppose either of them threw the knife
into the pond, do you?" asked Mrs. Ormond.</p>

<p>"Oh no!" answered her husband, laughing. "Only
I thought that if they heard that a policeman had
been called in, it might fill their heads with all kinds
of fancies, and I don't want to do that. Elsie, especially,
seems highly nervous, and is blessed with
a rather too vivid imagination. If it got on her
mind I don't know what blood-curdling story she
wouldn't be telling us next."</p>

<p>Punctually at the time appointed, Sergeant Evans
presented himself at the Pines, and was ushered into
the dining-room. He was a stout, rosy-cheeked man,
and so tall that he seemed almost obliged to stoop as
he entered the door.</p>

<p>"Good-evening, sergeant," said Mr. Ormond. "This
is the knife I spoke to you about. What d'you think
of it? Look at the blade."</p>

<p>The officer laid down his helmet and walking-cane,
and, taking the carver, subjected it to a careful
examination.</p>

<p>"Where did you say it was picked up, sir?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"It was at the bottom of our little pond," was the
answer. "The boys had one of their toy boats sunk,
and, in dragging for it with a rake, they brought up
this."</p>

<p>"At the bottom of the pond," murmured the policeman
thoughtfully. "Then it is evident that the
person who ground it down threw the knife into
the water, so that it shouldn't be found again.&mdash;You
don't remember on what day the knife was lost,
I suppose, ma'am?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm afraid I can't tell you that," answered
Mrs. Ormond. "We missed it first last Saturday
week; but we don't use it every day, so it might
have been before then."</p>

<p>"You've no idea who could have done this?"</p>

<p>"None whatever. We had an idea that one of the
boys might have been the culprit; but, as I said to
Mrs. Ormond, I don't think a boy could have ground
a knife blade down as cleverly as that."</p>

<p>The sergeant held the carver nearer to the lamp,
and looked at it for a few moments in silence.</p>

<p>"I've seen some queer tools," he said, "manufactured
by what's called a thieves' blacksmith, and
sometimes by the men themselves&mdash;all kinds of
odd contrivances, made out of the most unexpected
things you can imagine, from a knitting-needle to
a steel fork or a poker."</p>

<p>"You don't think that was done by a robber,
do you?" exclaimed Mrs. Ormond, looking up from
her work.</p>

<p>"No, ma'am; I can't see what the use of it could
have been, it's so thin and fragile. Now, if it had
been turned into a fine saw," the speaker continued,
feeling along the edge of the blade with his finger
and thumb, "it would have made me feel a bit suspicious.&mdash;I
suppose, sir, you've had no cause lately to
think the house has been broken into&mdash;no drawers
forced, or windows opened?"</p>

<p>"Oh no!" answered Mr. Ormond. "Nothing of
the kind."</p>

<p>The sergeant nodded. "It's difficult to understand,"
he said, "why any one should take the trouble to
grind a knife like this, and then throw it into a pond,
unless they was trying their 'and to see how thin the
blade could be made."</p>

<p>The speaker stood thoughtfully balancing the
carver across the palm of his large hand; then a
close observer might have seen the ghost of a smile
appear on his ruddy face.</p>

<p>"I expect, sir, you've got a grindstone on the
premises?"</p>

<p>"Yes, there's one out in the tool-house."</p>

<p>Evans made no reply, but after a moment's pause
laid the knife down on the table, and prepared to go.</p>

<p>"Then you don't think it was the work of a thief?"
inquired Mrs. Ormond, smiling.</p>

<p>"Oh no, ma'am," was the answer. "It don't strike
me as being that."</p>

<p>"By the way," said Mr. Ormond, "I suppose you
saw the account in the paper to-day of that terrible
shipwreck? You remember William Cole, my gardener?
The <i>Arcadia</i> was the ship he sailed on, and
I'm afraid there's very little doubt but that the
poor fellow's drowned. At all events, he's not mentioned
as one of the four passengers who were saved."</p>

<p>"Dear, dear!" exclaimed Evans, the little twinkle in
his eye disappearing in an instant. "So Will Cole was
on board that ship! Well, well, it's sad news, very!"</p>

<p>"It is," answered Mr. Ormond. "He had his
faults, but he seemed a sharp, promising young
fellow; and I hoped he'd do well in the Colonies."</p>

<p>"So did I, sir. When I heard he was going abroad
I thought it was about the best thing that could
happen. I was afraid that if he stayed on much
longer in these parts he'd find himself in trouble."</p>

<p>"Indeed?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," continued the man in blue, slowly, and
with his eyes bent on the tablecloth. "One don't
wish to talk ill of the dead, and I don't know as I've
got anything to say against Will himself more than
this, that of late he seemed to be getting mixed up
with them as would have done him no good."</p>

<p>"I knew nothing of this," said Mr. Ormond.</p>

<p>"No, I don't suppose you would, sir; but such
things naturally come under our notice, and he
wouldn't have been the first young chap I've seen
get associated with an idle, drinking, betting lot, and
then come to grief. However, the poor fellow's
beyond all that now, and I can only say I'm sorry
to hear of his death."</p>

<p>As Mr. Evans walked home, cogitating on the
interview which has just been described, the sly smile
once more returned to his face; and on entering his
own door, and being greeted with the savoury smell
of something hot for supper, his good-humour was so
far increased that he laughed aloud. Seated at table,
he entertained his wife with an account of his visit to
the magistrate's house.</p>

<p>"Well, what could have been the meaning of it
all?" inquired Mrs. Evans. "Where's the sense in
treating a knife in that fashion?"</p>

<p>The sergeant leant back in his chair and chuckled.
"It beat me for some time," he answered. "But then
I saw through it clear enough."</p>

<p>"And who done it, then? A burglar?"</p>

<p>"Burglar my grandmother!" replied Mr. Evans.
"No, 'twas like this&mdash;so at least I puts it together.
The servant gal, who ought to have kept the knife in
its proper place, leaves it lying about in the damp,
and lets the blade get rusty. Then, instead of telling
her mistress, she gets Cole to put it on the stone, or
else does it herself, and they keeps grinding away till
the knife's spoilt, and then, to end the matter, one of
'em chucks it into the pond, and so it gets lost."</p>

<p>"And didn't you tell Mrs. Ormond?"</p>

<p>"No fear! I couldn't say for certain. I wasn't
going to get the pore gal out of her place, so I gave
her the benefit of the doubt."</p>

<p>"Pore gal!" cried Mrs. Evans indignantly. "I'd
pore gal her, the careless hussy! I don't consider
you've done your duty, Samuel."</p>

<p>"Well, if I didn't," replied the culprit, "'twas
because I was reminded of the fact that you was
once in service yourself, Sarah."</p>

<p>"Get along with you!" cackled Mrs. Evans, trying
hard not to laugh, but failing in the attempt. "If I
was in service I didn't throw no carving-knives into
no fishponds."</p>

<div><img class="left" src="images/img079a.jpg" height="70" alt="I" title="" /></div>
<p class="noindent">t's my birthday on
Thursday, mother,"
said Guy. "Have
you decided what
you're going to
give me?"</p>

<p>"That sounds as
if you quite expected
a present,"
answered Mrs. Ormond,
laughing.</p>
<div><img class="figleft" src="images/img079.jpg" height="180" alt="GUY AND NAYLOR SEARCH" /></div>

<p>"Of course I do," continued
the boy. "And, I say, mother, can I ask Naylor to
come to tea and spend the evening? He's one of
the boarders, and a great friend of mine. I think
his Christian name is George, or Gerald, or something
of that sort."</p>

<p>"Would you prefer to ask him on some half-holiday,
when you can spend the afternoon together?" asked
Mrs. Ormond.</p>

<p>"Oh no, mother! I'd rather have him on my
birthday. We'll do our prep. work as soon as ever
we come back from school, and then we shall have
the whole evening free."</p>

<p>"What shall we do?" asked Ida. "Play games?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose so; but we shan't play any baby
games like 'Snap,' or 'Hunt the Slipper,'" answered
Guy loftily. "I think I'm going to invent a game
specially for the occasion."</p>

<p>The following day Guy returned home in high
spirits. He said he had been talking the matter
over with Naylor, and the two, between them, had
planned out a game which would be simply "ripping."
Having thus aroused every one's curiosity,
the boy refused to say any more, and, in answer to
numerous questions, merely answered, "Wait till to-morrow
evening, then you'll see."</p>

<p>Guy was greatly pleased with his presents, which
included a chest of carpenter's tools, the gift of his
father and mother, a book from the girls, and an air-pistol
from Brian. He was full, too, of mysterious
hints as to the new game, but refused to enter into
explanations till the time arrived for giving it a trial.
The boys were home early, and got through their
lessons for the next day before a ring at the bell
announced the arrival of the guest.</p>

<div><img class="figleft" src="images/img081.jpg" height="150" alt="NAYLOR" /></div>

<p>Naylor was a small boy, with rather a deep voice.
He wore a spotless turn-down collar, his hair was carefully
brushed, and he evidently had
on his "company manners," which
seemed to fit him rather badly, like
ready-made clothes. He spoke to
Brian in quite a deferential manner,
calling him Seaton, and he was evidently
shy of Elsie and Ida.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Nails, old chap!" cried Guy, seizing hold
of his guest, rumpling his hair, and giving him a slap
on the back which made him stagger. "Have you
come prepared for a good feed?"</p>

<p>"Shut up, Ormond," murmured the unfortunate
Naylor, glancing in the direction of the girls, and
flushing crimson. "Why can't you leave a fellow
alone?"</p>

<p>"You look so jolly tidy," laughed Guy.&mdash;"He's
usually all over ink&mdash;isn't he Brian?&mdash;and goes about
with only the lining of a cap on his head."</p>

<p>"It got torn," explained Naylor, in an apologetic
tone. "But I only wear it in the playground. I've
got a better one."</p>

<p>"I'm sure <i>you</i> needn't talk, Guy," put in Ida.
"You're untidy enough. I don't know what state
your clothes would get into if you lived away from
home."</p>

<p>"Oh, fiddles!" answered her brother. "Have you
brought your bicycle lamp, 'Nails'? Yes? That's
all right, then! Because if you hadn't I should have
sent you back again to fetch it, so it's lucky you
remembered. It's for the game we've invented," he
continued. "No, I shan't tell you what it is now.
I'll explain it after tea."</p>

<p>Brian had left the room, and Guy rushed away to
ask him something. Master Naylor, left unceremoniously
alone with the two girls, drew a long breath,
and nervously twisted his steel watch-chain. No one
would have supposed that that very morning he had
been sentenced to a term of extra drill for riotous
behaviour in the classroom; but "Nails" had inherited
the instincts of a gentleman, and he made a heroic
attempt to enter into conversation.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;er&mdash;you know Seaton?" he began.</p>

<p>"You mean Brian, I suppose," answered Ida, smiling.
"He's our cousin."</p>

<p>"Oh, of course," answered the visitor. "I remember
now. Ormond&mdash;that is, your brother&mdash;told me so.
Seaton is a fine chap; he plays in our football team."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," chimed in Elsie, who always liked
to hear Brian praised. "He's 'inside right.'"</p>

<p>The visitor began to feel more at home with the
girls.</p>

<p>"The best of Seaton is he doesn't stick on side," he
continued. "You know what I mean&mdash;isn't conceited.
Most fellows are when they get their cap. I wonder
if I shall ever play in the first team."</p>

<p>"I expect you will, some day," answered Ida kindly.</p>

<p>"D'you really think so?" inquired Master Naylor.
"I'm not very big," he continued, surveying himself
in a neighbouring looking-glass, with rather a wistful
look; "but I'm growing," he added with more
confidence.</p>

<p>At that moment Mrs. Ormond entered the room,
and a few minutes later the company sat down to tea.</p>

<p>"Mother, may we go out to the garden?" asked
Guy.</p>

<p>"Why, it's quite dark outside," was the reply.
"Can't you play indoors?"</p>

<p>"But it's our new game," said the boy. "It's
meant to be played in the dark. I'm sure it wouldn't
hurt us; it's not been raining, and the paths are quite
dry."</p>

<p>"Well, if you wrap up warm, I don't suppose it
would hurt you to go out for a bit," answered Mrs.
Ormond, smiling. "What is the new game? Don't
you think it's time you let us into the secret?"</p>

<p>"Shall we tell them, 'Nails'?" asked Guy.</p>

<p>Master Naylor's mouth was full of cheesecake, but
he nodded to show his consent.</p>

<p>"All right; I'll explain," continued Guy. "It's
going to be just like 'I spy,' only it's played with
bicycle lamps&mdash;that is, there will be two to seek, and
the rest will hide, and the seekers will have a lamp
each, so that they can find people in the dark.
They'll shout out, 'I spy So-and-So,' and then run
back to the den. If the person who's found can get
home first, then he's safe; but if he doesn't, then he's
got to be one of the seekers next time."</p>

<p>"Only one person seeks in 'I spy,'" said Ida.</p>

<p>"But it'll be more difficult to find people in the
dark," returned her brother, "and much easier to hide."</p>

<p>"Take care you don't set fire to anything with
your lamps," said his father.</p>

<p>"Mind you don't get oil on your clothes," added
Mrs. Ormond.</p>

<p>"No fear," answered Guy. "We shall be all right.
Will you excuse us, mother?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Let me see you're well wrapped up, and
don't stay out longer than half an hour."</p>

<p>The night was still and dark. The two rather
grubby bicycle lamps were at length induced to burn,
and the little party made their way into the garden.</p>

<p>"Now," said Guy; "this summer-house shall be
'home.' You know the rule; Ida and Naylor shall
seek first. Count fifty slowly, to give us time to
hide."</p>

<p>Brian, Guy, and Elsie scuttled away into the darkness,
while the two whose duty it was to search for
them began a monotonous chant of "One&mdash;two&mdash;three!"
ending with a triumphant shriek of "Fifty!"
and a warning cry of "We're coming!"</p>

<p>The game was a great success. There was plenty
of fun in finding hiding-places, and then crouching
down watching breathlessly as the lamps went flashing
up and down the paths, now coming dangerously
near, and then moving off again. Nor was it less
exciting, when seeking, to creep about, sending beams
of light into dark corners, as a policeman might when
hunting for a burglar. Then would come the shout
of "I spy!" followed by the mad rush back to the
summer-house, finder and found not infrequently
arriving at the den at the same moment.</p>

<p>There was no end of critical moments and hair-breadth
escapes; with one searcher it would have been
comparatively easy to work round and get to the den
unseen, but with two lamps flashing like miniature
search-lights in the darkness it was more difficult.
Once Guy nearly fell into the pond, while a little
later on Brian, blindly attempting to force his way
into the midst of a thick holly bush, gave a yell
which discovered his whereabouts to the enemy.</p>

<p>Warming up with the game, Naylor came out in
a manner which surprised the girls, who had hitherto
thought him rather quiet. He rushed about, and
seemed in all parts of the garden at once. No one
was safe when he was seeking, and where he managed
to find such secure hiding-places was a thing only
known to himself. Once only did he find himself in
difficulties.</p>

<p>"I spy 'Nails'!" shouted Guy. "Why don't you
run?" he added a moment later, as no one stirred.</p>

<p>"I can't!" was the plaintive reply heard in the
darkness.</p>

<p>"Why not?" demanded the searcher, coming back
a few paces, and directing his lamp towards his chum.</p>

<p>The redoubtable Naylor was seen crouching awkwardly
in a gap in the hedge at the bottom of the
garden.</p>

<p>"I say," he remarked in accents of distress, "this
beastly barbed wire has hooked my trousers leg and
the back of my coat, and I can't stir."</p>

<p>Guy roared with laughter, and proceeded to set his
friend at liberty. The half-hour would soon be up,
and the duty of seeking devolved on Elsie and Brian.
Ida was soon found, Naylor was discovered up a tree
this time, but Guy seemed to have disappeared from
off the face of the earth.</p>

<p>"I wonder where the fellow has got to," said Brian.</p>

<p>"He may be somewhere in the yard," answered
Elsie, "though he said that it was out of bounds."</p>

<p>She ran off, followed by her cousin. There was no
Guy behind the pump, and she made straight for the
tool-house. Lifting the latch, and standing just inside
the door, the light from her bull's-eye fell on the old
familiar objects. There was the grindstone, there the
iron-bound box, and there&mdash;</p>

<p>Suddenly the lamp dropped from Elsie's hand,
and fell with a clatter on the stones. With a
shriek of terror she turned and rushed across the
yard.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Elsie?" cried Brian, who had
been exploring the coal-hole, and now ran after his
little cousin, catching her up as she arrived at the
glass door of the house.</p>

<p>"I saw it! I saw it!" panted the child, hardly
knowing what she said. "Let me go in!"</p>

<p>"Saw what?" asked the boy, endeavouring to soothe
her. "What's the matter? Are you frightened?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Elsie, catching hold of his arm,
and looking over her shoulder. "But&mdash;but don't tell
any one, Bri. You won't, will you?"</p>

<p>"Well, tell me what you thought you saw. I
won't make fun of you."</p>

<p>Elsie, however, would give no reply, but refused to
play any more, and went indoors. Brian went across
to the tool-house, flashed his lamp up and down, but
could see nothing beyond what was to be found there
any time.</p>

<p>The half-hour being up, and Guy having disclosed
his whereabouts, which turned out to be a snug retreat
between the back of a cucumber frame and the wall,
the party returned to the house, and spent the rest of
the evening till supper time playing indoor games.</p>

<p>"I don't think Elsie's quite well," said Mrs. Ormond
later on, when Master Naylor had departed, and the
children had gone upstairs to bed. Brian happened
to be still in the room.</p>

<p>"I think she was frightened at something she
imagined she saw in the dark, when we were playing
'I spy,' aunt," he remarked.</p>

<p>"What a nervous child she's getting!" was the
reply. "I can't understand it. She used to be
brave enough, and now she's as timid as a kitten."</p>

<h3>A FRESH DISCOVERY.</h3>

<div><img class="left" src="images/img090a.jpg" height="70" alt="S" title="" /></div>
<p class="noindent">aturday had come round
again, and as the children
started for school that morning
not one of them guessed
what an eventful day it was
going to prove. Meeting in
the road outside the Pines
on their return, they passed
together through the gate,
and along the drive.</p>
<div><img class="figleft" src="images/img090.jpg" height="180" alt="GUY WITH THE AIR PISTOL" /></div>
<p>"Hooray!" exclaimed Guy,
swinging his bundle of books round and round at the
end of the strap. "No more work till Monday! I
thought I should have been kept in for C&aelig;sar to-day,
but I just happened to get an easy bit with
words I knew."</p>

<p>"It's a wonder you ever know anything," remarked
Ida, who was rather fond of reproving other people.
"You are always drawing, or cutting up pen-holders
with your knife, or doing something of that kind,
when you ought to be preparing your work. Elsie's
getting just the same. She sat staring at the wall
all yesterday evening, and the consequence was that
this morning she got both lessons returned. She's
getting such a little funk, too, that she won't go
up to bed alone, but waits on the stairs till I come."</p>

<p>"Oh, what a cram!" exclaimed Elsie, rather feebly.</p>

<p>"It's not a cram," returned her sister. "You know
it's perfectly true, and you look under the bed too,
expecting to find a hidden robber, I suppose."</p>

<p>In a playful manner Brian caught hold of Elsie by
the back of the neck, much in the same way as he
might have done a small boy at the Grammar School,
but with perhaps a lighter touch.</p>

<p>"Come, what's the matter with you?" he asked.
"You never used to be afraid of the dark; you were
as bold as brass. What have you done? Murdered
somebody?"</p>

<p>"No," answered Elsie, laughing. "I'm only&mdash;only
a bit silly."</p>

<p>She looked up with a smile as she spoke. No one
ever doubted Brian's pluck, and the fact that he did
not think her a coward encouraged Elsie to be brave.
Brian knew that something really had frightened the
child on the previous Thursday evening, but he had
not mentioned the matter to any one except Mrs.
Ormond, for which Elsie was in her heart devoutly
thankful to him, as she knew what a "roasting"
she would receive from Ida and Guy if once they got
hold of the story.</p>

<p>But though Brian forbore to tell what he knew, or
even to question her further, yet the incident had
been constantly in his mind. He wondered greatly
what could have been the cause of his cousin's alarm,
and why she should refuse to explain this when
hitherto he had always been in her confidence.
On Friday, without saying anything to anybody,
Brian made a careful examination of the tool-house,
hoping to find some clue to the mystery; but his
search proved fruitless.</p>

<p>There was nothing in the place calculated to alarm
the most timorous of mortals; and as the boy glanced
round he saw simply just what he had seen there
many times before&mdash;the grindstone, Uncle Roger's
box, some gardening tools, and sticks for rose-trees
and other plants, a quantity of matting stuff which
had been wrapped round some plants and shrubs
when they came from a nursery, some old hampers,
and a short wooden bench on which the new boy,
Henry, cleaned the knives and boots. There was
certainly nothing here to cause any one to drop a
lamp and run screaming into the house.</p>

<p>Still, Brian was not satisfied. He was perhaps
rather pleased to think that there was some mystery
connected with the tool-house; it was like trying to
solve a very interesting puzzle.</p>

<p>"If only I had a clever detective here, like Sherlock
Holmes!" he said to himself. "I suppose he'd
just look round and find some clue which would explain
the whole matter. I must confess I can't see
anything. Now <i>that's</i> what began it all," he continued,
as his eye rested on the grindstone. "I
believe Elsie really did hear some one turning that
stone, and it's my opinion that he, or she, whoever it
might have been, was grinding the carving-knife; but
there the story stops short, and doesn't seem to go any
further. Besides, that doesn't explain what frightened
Elsie the other evening. I wish she'd tell me, but
I'm afraid she won't."</p>

<p>Brian went over and began carelessly working the
grindstone with his left foot on the treadle. "I know
what I'll do," he thought. "Each night I'll come out
and tie the crank of this thing to the stand with
a piece of thin black cotton; then I shall soon find
out if any one comes and works here at night, for if
they do, the thread will be broken in the morning."</p>

<p>Without saying anything to the others, he slipped
out on Friday evening and set his trap; but when he
went to examine it on the following morning the
cotton was still unbroken, though it snapped at once
the moment he pressed down the treadle. Nothing
daunted by his failure, Brian made up his mind to
try the same thing several nights running, and with
this determination had hurried away to join his
cousins as they started for school.</p>

<p>"Where's father?" inquired Ida, as the family
assembled at the dinner-table.</p>

<p>"He's gone to Ashvale on business," answered Mrs.
Ormond. "He won't be back before this evening."</p>

<p>"There's no football
this afternoon, is there,
Brian?" asked Guy.</p>

<div><img class="figright" src="images/img094.jpg" height="110" alt="THE AIR PISTOL" /></div>

<p>"No practice game,"
was the answer. "There's
a second-eleven match, but I don't think I shall go
to the field. It's too cold to stand doing nothing."</p>

<p>"Then look here," continued Guy, "I'll tell you
what well do; we'll make a target, and try my air-pistol.
I know where there's a piece of board that'll
do, and we can mark it out with rings and a bull's-eye
with your compasses."</p>

<p>"By the way, Guy," said Mrs. Ormond suddenly,
"I knew there was something I wanted to speak to
you about. You remember the cork that was inside
Uncle Roger's box? Well, I've found where it came
from."</p>

<p>There was an exclamation of interest from the two
girls as they raised their heads to listen.</p>

<p>"Have you, mother?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mrs. Ormond, with a half-smile on her
face. "It came out of cook's methylated spirit bottle.
You may remember that some little time ago she
found it standing empty."</p>

<p>"But how could the cork have got into the box?"
cried Ida.</p>

<p>"It seems to me," answered her mother, "that it
must have been dropped by accident into the chest
by the person who emptied the bottle, and therefore
that same person must have been helping us when we
opened the box."</p>

<p>"I know what you're driving at, mother," exclaimed
Guy. "You think I used the spirit, and
I've told you heaps of times I didn't. How does
cook know it's the same cork? There may be hundreds
of corks exactly the same size, and you couldn't
tell one from another."</p>

<p>"There was no mistaking this one for another,"
was the answer. "It had once been stuck in a bottle
of red ink, and the end was stained."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know anything about it," said Guy.
"Perhaps," he continued, struck with a bright idea&mdash;"perhaps
father cribbed the spirit to fill that thing
he lights his pipes and cigars with, and he may have
dropped the cork into the box. You'd better ask him
when he comes home."</p>

<p>There was a laugh, in which Mrs. Ormond joined.
"I don't think your father is the culprit," she answered.&mdash;"Of
course, if Guy says he hasn't touched
the bottle, we must believe him.&mdash;Ida, did you or
Elsie use the spirit for anything?"</p>

<p>Both girls shook their heads, and Brian also declared
himself innocent.</p>

<p>"It's a rum thing how it came to be inside the
chest," he remarked. "It's just like a conjuring trick."</p>

<p>"It certainly seems very funny," replied his aunt;
"but, like most conjuring tricks, I dare say the explanation
would be very simple if it were ever given."</p>

<p>Guy was impatient to test the power and accuracy
of his birthday present. He painted a bull's-eye on
a piece of board, with rings numbered 1, 2, 3, each
about two inches wide, and then the question was to
find a suitable place for practice.</p>

<p>"It's a beastly cold wind outside," he said; "I
know what we'll do. We'll hang it up in the tool-house.
Come on, Ida
and Elsie; we'll all
have a try."</p>

<div><img class="figleft" src="images/img097.jpg" height="320" alt="IDA" /></div>

<p>The elder sister responded
readily, but
Elsie hung back, made some
excuse, and went off in another
direction.</p>

<p>"What a little noodle she's
becoming!" remarked Ida to
Brian, as Guy proceeded to hang
up the target. "I believe, for
some reason or other, she's taken
it into her head to be afraid to
go inside this tool-house. She
won't go near it, not even in broad daylight."</p>

<p>"Let's go and bring her," suggested Guy.</p>

<p>"Oh, I shouldn't," answered Brian. "You'll never
cure her that way. The best thing is to leave her
alone, and take no notice. She'll get over it in time."</p>

<p>The air-pistol was great fun. Ida proved as good
a shot as either of the boys, and it was difficult to
decide which could lay claim to being the best
marksman of the three.</p>

<p>"We'll have six shots each, firing in turn," said
Guy. "Ida shall begin, and I'll put down the scores
on this bit of paper."</p>

<p>The contest was an exciting one. Ida, unfortunately,
missed the target twice, and so got behind the
others, but Brian and Guy were so close together that
it remained for the last shot to show which had won
the first place. Brian fired, and the little steel dart
struck close to the bull's-eye.</p>

<p>"Now, then!" cried Guy, reloading the pistol.
"I must take extra good aim this time and get a bull.
Oh, bother!"</p>

<p>He had been standing looking at the target as he
spoke, and holding the pistol with the muzzle pointing
upwards. Incautiously his finger had tightened
on the trigger, with the result that the little weapon
suddenly went off.</p>

<p>"O Guy, you should be more careful!" exclaimed
Ida. "You might have hurt somebody."</p>

<p>"Hang it all!" muttered her brother. "Now I've
lost the dart."</p>

<p>"There it is," said Brian&mdash;"straight over your head."</p>

<p>He pointed as he spoke to a little red tuft that
showed the dart was firmly embedded in one of the
beams which supported the roof.</p>

<p>"Good business!" cried Guy. "We'll soon have
it down. Ida, drag over that old chest, and if Brian
will stand on it with me hoisted on to his shoulders,
I believe I can reach it right enough."</p>

<p>The experiment was tried, but the beam was still
just out of reach of Guy's hand.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what we can do," he said; "turn the
chest up on end, and that'll make it higher."</p>

<p>As Guy moved the box into the required position
there was an audible rustle and bump.</p>

<p>"Hullo, there's something inside!" he exclaimed.</p>

<h3>ELSIE'S CONFESSION.</h3>

<div><img class="left" src="images/img100.jpg" height="170" alt="S" title="" /></div>
<p class="noindent">omething inside!" exclaimed Ida,
as the trio stood for a moment
staring at Uncle Roger's box.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered her brother. "Didn't
you hear it move? You listen; I'll do
it again."</p>

<p>There was not the slightest doubt that
the chest was no longer empty.</p>

<p>"But it's locked," said Ida, "and has been ever
since the evening when it was first opened; and
father has the keys of the two padlocks."</p>

<p>"Well, it's not empty now," returned her brother.
"I say, I wonder what on earth it can be? Let's
go in and ask mother if she put anything inside."</p>

<p>The air-pistol was forgotten, and the party at
once adjourned to the house to make further inquiries.
They found Mrs. Ormond in the
dining-room, but she was unable to throw any light on
the subject.</p>

<p>"Neither your father nor I put anything into the
box," she said. "It was locked up and taken
straight out into the tool-house. Of course, he may
have put something in since, but I think it hardly
likely."</p>

<p>"But what can it be then, mother?" exclaimed
Ida anxiously.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know," was the answer. "You'll
have to wait till your father returns before you can
find out, for he has got the keys of the padlocks on
his bunch."</p>

<p>"When will he be back?"</p>

<p>"Not before seven o'clock, I expect."</p>

<p>"Oh, bother!" cried Guy. "Fancy having to wait
all that time!"</p>

<p>There was no alternative but to curb their impatience
as best they might, and the young people
strolled back to the tool-house to have another look
at the chest.</p>

<p>"Listen while I turn it up," said Guy, "and see
if we can guess what's inside."</p>

<p>It was impossible to determine the contents of
the box in this manner.</p>

<p>"I should think it was a parcel of some kind,"
said Ida. "You'd better not do that any more, Guy.
It may be something that will break if it's rolled
and banged about."</p>

<p>"Whatever it is," remarked Brian, "I expect uncle
put it inside before he locked the box again."</p>

<p>"But mother said he didn't," persisted Guy. "I
do believe the old thing is bewitched. First, after
it's been locked and sealed up for twenty years, and
was supposed to contain all kinds of precious things,
it was found to have nothing at all in it but a cork
(which doesn't count); and now, when every one
declares it was put away empty, there's something
inside."</p>

<p>No further discovery was likely to be made by
simply lingering about staring at the outside of the
chest, so, having recovered the air-pistol dart with
the aid of a pair of steps, the trio dispersed, and
went their several ways.</p>

<p>Brian strolled off down the garden, but had not
gone far when he heard some one running after him,
and turning round saw Elsie.</p>

<p>"O Bri!" she cried, "is it true that there's something
in Uncle Roger's box?"</p>

<p>"It seems so," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Well, <i>how</i> can it have got there?" cried the
child, her eyes growing rounder with excitement.
"Isn't it wonderful? D'you think it's anything
valuable?"</p>

<p>"I think we'd better not make any more guesses
about that box until we see it opened," answered the
boy, laughing; "though if you like to come and listen
I'll turn the chest over. You'll then hear the hidden
treasure moving inside, and can decide whether it
sounds like a bundle of bank-notes, silver-plate, or
bags of money."</p>

<p>If he had proposed a visit to the dentist, Elsie
could not have shown greater reluctance to accept
the invitation.</p>

<p>"I shan't go near that old tool-house again," she
said slowly.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Will you promise you won't say anything? I
wouldn't tell any one else but you, because I know
they would only laugh at me, and say I was a
coward."</p>

<p>"I won't say anything," answered the boy, smiling.
"Come on&mdash;out with it! What's been the matter
with you the last few days?"</p>

<p>Brian never broke his promises; his word was
always to be trusted. It was with almost a sigh
of relief that Elsie prepared to unburden herself of
a secret which she had hitherto been keeping locked
within her own bosom.</p>

<p>"I had an awful fright," she began. "You know
when we were playing 'I spy' I went into the tool-house,
and I&mdash;I saw something."</p>

<p>"Well, what did you see?"</p>

<p>"O Bri!" continued the girl, lowering her voice,
and the startled look appearing once more on her
face, "<i>I saw William Cole!</i>"</p>

<p>"Saw William Cole!" repeated Brian in astonishment.
"What on earth d'you mean? Why, William,
poor fellow, is drowned, and at the bottom of the sea,
hundreds of miles from here."</p>

<p>"I know," gasped Elsie breathlessly. "But I saw
him, all the same. The light of the lamp fell right
on him. He was standing quite still, looking at me.
I saw him as plainly as I see you now; and&mdash;O Bri,"
the child continued, covering her eyes with her hands,
"I'm afraid to be left alone in the dark for fear I
should see him again."</p>

<p>Brian felt sorry for his little cousin.</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense, Elsie!" he said, taking her arm
after the manner of a good comrade. "Don't go
imagining that you've seen a ghost, because you
haven't. It was all fancy. Look here; after you'd
gone indoors I went myself and looked into the
tool-house to see what had frightened you, and
there was nothing there. You must buck up, and
make up your mind you won't give way to your
fears. Now come on with me, and we'll explore
the tool-house together."</p>

<p>It cost Elsie a great effort, but she at length
allowed herself to be persuaded; and, arm in arm,
the two cousins made their way
to the tool-house. There was
certainly no sign of poor
William, but that Elsie was
firmly persuaded in her own
mind that she had seen him
was evident enough.</p>

<div><img class="figright" src="images/img105.jpg" height="200" alt="BRIAN AND ELSIE" /></div>

<p>"He stood there,"
she whispered, pointing
with her finger, and
shivering at the recollection.
"He never
moved, and never spoke, and then I let the lamp
fall and ran away. You won't tell any one, will
you, Brian? Remember, you've promised."</p>

<p>"Oh, I won't tell," answered the boy good-naturedly;
"but the sooner you get rid of these
fancies the better."</p>

<p>The curtains had been drawn and the lamp lit; it
was nearly tea-time, and Jane was then laying the
table.</p>

<p>"There, now!" exclaimed Mrs. Ormond suddenly;
"I've let Henry go home without asking him to
leave word at Mrs. Budd's for her not to come on
Monday. How forgetful I'm getting!"</p>

<p>"Is it anything I can do for you, aunt?" asked
Brian.</p>

<p>"Oh no, my dear; thank you," was the answer.
"I wanted Henry to tell Mrs. Budd, the washer-woman,
not to come on Monday."</p>

<p>"Shall I take the message for you?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, Brian; she lives in Bridge Lane&mdash;right
on the other side of the town. If it had been nearer
I would have asked you to go."</p>

<p>"Oh, it wouldn't take me long, aunt," answered the
boy. "I'll ride on my bicycle; the lamp is trimmed;
and I can have my tea when I come back."</p>

<p>"It's very kind of you to offer," answered Mrs.
Ormond, hesitating. "I almost think I will ask you
to go, if you're sure you aren't tired. I don't want
to bring the poor soul all this way on Monday morning
for nothing."</p>

<p>Brian started off at once, saying he should be back
in half an hour; and his aunt and cousins sat down
to tea.</p>

<p>"I hope father won't be later than seven," said
Guy, glancing at the clock on the mantelpiece. "I
want to know what's in that chest."</p>

<p>"Brian's been longer than he said," he remarked
when, at the end of the meal, he pushed back his
chair and rose from the table. "I expect he hasn't
been able to find the old woman's house, or perhaps
his tyre's punctured. Hullo! There's father!"</p>

<p>The boy's quick ears had caught the rattle of a
latch-key, and immediately there was a rush into
the hall. Mr. Ormond entered with the collar of
his greatcoat turned up.</p>

<p>"Phew! it's cold," he said. "Hullo! What's the
matter now?" Guy and Ida were both speaking
at once.</p>

<p>"Father, did you put anything in Uncle Roger's
box? It isn't empty now; there's something inside!"</p>

<p>"What d'you mean? I don't understand."</p>

<p>Hurriedly Ida gave the necessary explanation.</p>

<p>"I never put anything into the chest," said Mr.
Ormond, with a puzzled look. "I locked it up, and
told Henry to carry it into the tool-house."</p>

<p>"Well, there's something in it now!" cried Guy.
"Father, lend us your keys, and let us go out and
open it at once."</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense!" was the answer. "Wait until
Monday."</p>

<p>"We've been waiting all the afternoon," pleaded
Ida. "Do let us have the keys!"</p>

<p>"Very well," laughed her father, producing a bunch
from his pocket. "These are the ones. If you take
a light out, don't set the place on fire."</p>

<p>"Won't you leave it till Brian comes back?"
suggested Elsie; but her brother and sister had
already started off in the direction of the yard door.</p>

<p>Elsie had shuddered at the very thought of going
near that tool-house in the dark; but, ghost or no
ghost, she meant to see that box opened. As the
saying goes, she took her courage in both hands,
and ran quickly after Guy and Ida.</p>

<p class="noindent">er brother and sister were already in the tool-house
when Elsie arrived at the door. She
so far conquered her fears as to
enter, but could not help one
timid glance round, as though
she might once more be confronted with the ghost
of William Cole. Dead or alive, however, there was
no sign of the gardener, and nothing more terrible
to be seen than her old friend the grindstone.</p>

<div><img class="figleft" src="images/img109.jpg" height="100" alt="PAPERS" /></div>

<p>Guy carried a candle which he had procured from
the kitchen, and which guttered and smoked in the
draught.</p>

<p>"Do be careful with that light," said Ida. "You'll
burn the place down if you don't mind what you're
about."</p>

<p>"Oh, all right!" answered Guy, preparing to drag
the chest out into the middle of the floor. "I don't
think it's much heavier than usual. I do wonder
what's inside."</p>

<p>"Well, be quick and open it!" cried his sister,
taking the candle and holding it so that its light
would fall into the chest when its lid was raised.
"Let's see for ourselves, and then we shall know for
certain."</p>

<p>There was a moment's delay while Guy found the
proper keys. First one and then the other padlock
fell with a clank on to the bricks, the iron hasps
were raised, and, with a "Here goes!" Guy flung
back the lid.</p>

<p>Once more the children leant forward and peered
down into this wonderful box. Elsie was the first
to speak, and all she said was "Oh!" But the tone
of her voice was enough to proclaim another disappointment.</p>

<p>Jewellery? Bank-notes? Bags of money? What
was it they beheld? None of these things, but only
a bundle of papers, tied together with a piece of
faded red tape.</p>

<p>"Well!" cried Ida, flushing with vexation, "I'll
never hope for anything again!"</p>

<p>Guy picked up the bundle, and examined it more
closely. The documents were all neatly folded, and
were mostly docketed on the outside in heavy black
writing. Some were of parchment; and one, he
noticed, had in one corner three small red seals on
a narrow strip of green ribbon.</p>

<p>"I wonder what these are!" said the boy. "Bah!"
he added, holding the packet to his nose; "they smell
musty enough. Let's take them in and show them
to father."</p>

<p>Mr. Ormond had sat down to his tea, and seemed
to have already dismissed Uncle Roger's box from
his mind; the sight, however, of the children entering
the room brought it back to his remembrance.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, jokingly, "have you found anything?"</p>

<p>"Nothing particular," answered Guy. "Only this
old bundle of papers."</p>

<p>Mr. Ormond was in the act of raising his cup of
tea to his lips; he paused, then lowered it without
drinking.</p>

<p>"Papers!" he repeated, gazing at the packet with
a puzzled look on his face. "What papers are they?
Let me see."</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind about it now," said Mrs. Ormond.
"Drink your tea while it's hot."</p>

<p>"One moment, mother," answered her husband.
He untied the tape, and glanced first at one then
at another of the clearly-written inscriptions on the
folded documents. As he did so, the expression on
his face became one of unbounded astonishment; and
the children, quick to observe the change on his face,
began to wonder what could be the cause of his
surprise.</p>

<p>"You say you found these in the old box?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, father. What are they?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Ormond rose from her chair at the end of the
table, and came round to where her husband was
sitting. She, too, had seen his look of amazement,
and wondered what it could mean.</p>

<p>"What are they, father?" repeated Guy.</p>

<p>"What are they?" was the reply. "Why&mdash;why,
I'll tell you what they are. This is Uncle Roger's
legacy."</p>

<p>"Uncle Roger's legacy!" cried Ida. "D'you mean
to say that all he left you, father, was that dirty
old bundle of papers? Pooh! he might have kept
them to himself!"</p>

<p>"You don't understand, Ida," was the answer, in
a voice which showed that her father himself was
not a little excited. "These papers are valuable."</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Elsie suddenly. "Are they as valuable
as bank-notes?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes," replied Mr. Ormond, laughing. "I
think one may say they are. They are deeds and
securities which represent a nice bit of property;
and a good sum of money must have accumulated
on some of them in twenty years. In fact, I'm not
sure, Elsie, if we shan't be able to consider that
promise about a pony."</p>

<p>There was a yell from Guy. He, Ida, and Elsie
all tore round and round the room in a state of
frantic excitement.</p>

<p>"Hurrah! hurrah for old Uncle Roger!" cried
the boy.</p>

<p>"But, father," exclaimed Ida, pausing at length,
completely out of breath, "if he meant it to be yours,
why did he make you wait twenty years?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I can't explain," was the reply, "more
than this, that he was a curious old fellow, and
often did the most eccentric things. What puzzles
me more than that is to know where these papers
have suddenly sprung from. You say you found
them in the box. When did you first discover that
it had anything inside?"</p>

<p>"Only this afternoon," answered Guy. "We turned
it up, and heard something slide along the bottom
and go bump against the end."</p>

<p>"Then how in the world was it that when we
opened the chest the other day it was empty?"</p>

<p>"We thought you must have put it in," murmured
Ida. "It is strange. How can it have happened?"</p>

<p>"D'you think they really were in the box all those
years?" asked Mrs. Ormond.</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly. Where else could they have
been?"</p>

<p>"O father," cried Ida suddenly, "I believe you
knew about them all the time! You took them
away yourself just to tease us. It's some joke."</p>

<p>"Indeed it isn't. I know no more about them
than either of you children; but it's a most astonishing
thing, and one I should like very much to have
explained."</p>

<p>"Well, come out and have another look at the
box," suggested Guy.</p>

<p>"Wait till your father's finished his tea," interposed
Mrs. Ormond. "I wonder where Brian is all
this time," she added. "I wish he were back. He'll
be interested to hear of this discovery."</p>

<p>The children were so excited that they found it
difficult to keep still. Guy especially wandered
restlessly up and down the room as though he were a
wild beast in a cage.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I believe it is," he exclaimed
suddenly; "that old box has got either a false lid
or a false bottom. That's where the papers were
hidden, and in moving it about, the spring was
somehow released, and they tumbled out."</p>

<p>After so many surprises, the young folks were
ready to believe almost anything.</p>

<p>"Well, let's go out and see!" cried Ida.&mdash;"Father,
you come when you've finished your tea."</p>

<p>Once more there was a rush to the tool-house,
Guy, this time, borrowing a lamp from the kitchen,
which gave a better light than the candle. Certainly
this old box of Uncle Roger's seemed just the very
sort of chest which one might expect to possess some
concealed spring which, when touched, would disclose
a secret hiding-place; but tapping and measurements
inside and out proved that there was nothing in its
construction which caused it to differ from any other
oak chest strengthened with bands of iron.</p>

<p>"Well, this licks me!" exclaimed Guy, rising from
his knees. "The only explanation I can give is that
the thing must be enchanted."</p>

<p>"I <i>should</i> like to know what it all means," said
Ida. "Perhaps father will be able to tell when he
comes. I hope he won't be long."</p>

<p>"Fancy a pony!" cried Elsie. "D'you think he
really will give us one?"</p>

<p>"He said he'd consider it," answered Guy; "but
I expect that means 'yes.' Hurrah! I tell you what
I shall do. I shall go hunting."</p>

<p>The speaker gave vent to his delight by hopping
about on one leg; then, coming in contact with the
grindstone, he put his foot on the treadle, and began
to work it as fast as he could.</p>

<p>"The water's all dried up," he said at length, when
the stone stopped. Without thinking what he was
doing, he put his hand into the trough, and began
poking his fingers into the sediment which had collected
at the bottom. In the soft mud was something
hard, and he picked it out. The boy glanced
carelessly at the bit of metal, and was about to throw
it away when its shape struck him as familiar.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" he exclaimed. "Look what I've found!"</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Ida.</p>

<p>"Can't you see?" was the answer. "Why, it's the
little knob from the handle of that poultry-carver!"</p>

<p>"Then that proves Brian and I were right!" cried
Elsie excitedly. "It <i>was</i> the carver that was being
ground when I heard the stone turning that night.
Mother said the knob was loose, and it must have
fallen off into the water."</p>

<p>"Get away!" answered Guy obstinately. "It
might have fallen off the knife some time when
William Cole had it out here to clean, and dropped
into the trough by accident. You won't get me to
believe that yarn of yours, Elsie."</p>

<p>Elsie was about to reply, when her sister cut short
the dispute by exclaiming, "Here's father!"</p>

<p>The carving-knife was for the moment forgotten.
Mr. Ormond examined the box, turned it over first
on one side then on the other, rapped the boards
with his knuckles, and at length shook his head.</p>

<p>"I can't understand it," he said, with a puzzled
smile. "It's a mystery."</p>

<p>"O father! don't you think we shall ever find it
out?" asked Ida.</p>

<p>Before Mr. Ormond had time to reply there was
a sound of footsteps in the yard, and Brian's voice
was heard calling, "Uncle!"</p>

<p>"Hullo! Here I am. What d'you want?"</p>

<p>The boy came hurrying into the tool-house; there
was a curious expression on his face of excitement
mingled with anxiety.</p>

<p>"You're wanted in the house, please, uncle&mdash;now
at once."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"I can't explain; but please come at once. It's
very important."</p>

<p>Mr. Ormond turned to comply with this request.</p>

<p>"I say," shouted Guy, anxious to be the first to
break the news to his cousin, "we've found what
was in the box. It was Uncle Roger's legacy&mdash;a
bundle of papers."</p>

<p>"I know," answered Brian calmly.</p>

<p>"What!" cried Ida. "D'you know how they got
there?" she added eagerly.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the boy, wrenching himself free
from Guy's grasp, and starting off to follow his uncle
into the house. "I can't explain it now, but I'll tell
you presently."</p>

<h3>THE RIDDLE SOLVED.</h3>

<div><img class="left" src="images/img119a.jpg" height="50" alt="W" title="" /></div>
<p class="noindent">hen Brian started
off on his aunt's
errand, he little
thought that carrying
a simple message
to a washer-woman
would lead
him into an altogether
unexpected
adventure.</p>

<div><img class="figleft" src="images/img119.jpg" height="260" alt="BRIAN SEES COLE" /></div>

<p>Hastily putting on his
short overcoat and cap, he
lighted his lamp, mounted his bicycle, and went
swiftly off down the road. Bridge Lane was away
at the opposite side of the town, a part which he
had not visited before; and he had to dismount
several times to make inquiries before he finally
reached the door of Mrs. Budd's cottage. Having
delivered his message, he had nothing further to do
than turn his machine round and ride home. At
this point the thought struck him that in coming
through the town he had gone a longer way than
he need have done, and that a road branching off
to the right would be a shorter cut back to the
suburb in which his uncle's house was situated.</p>

<p>He rode on for ten minutes, and then slackened
speed, for he began to doubt whether he was, after
all, on a more direct route. Though quiet and deserted,
the road was lit at intervals with gas lamps,
and by their uncertain light Brian saw a man some
distance on ahead, walking in the same direction as
that in which he himself was going.</p>

<p>"I'll ask that fellow if I'm right," he muttered,
and increased his pace with a vigorous thrust on the
pedals.</p>

<p>The man did not hear the noiseless approach
of the bicycle until it was close behind him; then
he turned quickly as the rider slowed down and
spoke.</p>

<p>"Can you tell me&mdash;" Brian began, but he got no
further. For a moment he entirely lost control of
the machine, with the result that he narrowly missed
being upset in the gutter. A gas-lamp was close at
hand, and in its light he had a full view of the
stranger's face, and recognized him in a moment&mdash;William
Cole!</p>

<p>Brian was, perhaps, not quite so easily frightened
as Elsie; it never struck him that the figure before
him was anything but flesh and blood; still, the
sudden appearance on a dark road of a man whom
everybody believed to have been drowned so astonished
him that it was a few moments before he
recovered even the use of his tongue.</p>

<p>He put on the brake, and jumped <ins title="original has of">off</ins> his machine;
but the man had already turned, and was making
off hurriedly in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>"William! Stop a moment!"</p>

<p>The man paid no attention. There was a stile close
at hand; he turned, jumped over it, and disappeared
in the darkness.</p>

<p>Here was indeed a mystery; and Brian, for some
reason, felt that he must discover what it meant.
Leaving his bicycle propped against the lamp-post,
he dashed off in pursuit. Being a fast runner, and
in good training from football, he soon recovered the
little advantage which the man had gained at the
start, and overtook him before he had reached the
opposite side of the field.</p>

<p>"William! What brings you here? We thought
you had gone down on board the <i>Arcadia</i>."</p>

<p>For a few seconds the man seemed too much
out of breath to speak; then he gasped out a confused
jumble of words, which Brian could hardly
understand.</p>

<p>"Don't you tell the master you've seen me, Mr.
Brian. I was going away to-night. I know I've
done wrong; but I've put it right again, and the
only one who's hurt is myself."</p>

<p>"I don't understand you," answered Brian. "Look
here," he continued, struck with a sudden thought;
"you were in the tool-house at the Pines the other
evening. What were you doing?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I frightened Miss Elsie," returned the
man, evading the question. "I suppose she told Mr.
Ormond."</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact, she didn't; but of course I
shall tell him I've seen you when I get back. Come,
William, what's the matter? What does it all mean?
Are you in trouble? Because, if so, you know we'd
any of us help you if we could."</p>

<p>To Brian's astonishment Cole made no reply, but
in the darkness drew his coat sleeve across his eyes
with an audible sob.</p>

<div><img class="figleft" src="images/img123.jpg" height="170" alt="COLE SOBS" /></div>

<p>"I am in trouble, sir," he answered at length.
"And it's trouble of my own making. I'm done
for&mdash;ruined! That's what's
the matter with me."</p>

<p>"Ruined!" repeated the boy.
"What do you mean? Come
back to where I've left my
bicycle. Now that you've
told me so much, you may
as well let me have the whole story."</p>

<p>They retraced their steps in silence, Cole apparently
making up his mind whether or not he should
disclose the story of his misfortunes.</p>

<p>"I might as well make a clean breast of the
matter," he muttered. "It'll all come out sooner or
later. When you speak to the master, sir," he continued,
"you'll say what you can for me, I hope.
I'm sorry for what's past, and I've done my best to
make amends."</p>

<p>Looking at his companion as they came once more
under the light of the gas-lamp, Brian was astonished
to see what a change had taken place in his appearance.
He looked ill and careworn; his clothes were
untidy, and his chin had evidently not been shaved
for days.</p>

<p>"You needn't be afraid to tell me everything," said
the boy. "I'm sorry if you're in a mess, and I'll do
what I can to get you out of it, William."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," was the reply.</p>

<p>They walked slowly along the deserted road, and
as they did so Cole told his story.</p>

<p>"It was my own fault," he began. "I got to
spending my evenings with a lot of young chaps
at the 'Red Horse,' and soon I was short of money.
They was a betting lot, and one of 'em told me if
I could lay my hand on as much as fifty pound, he'd
put me on to a way of making a fortune. I needn't
trouble you now, sir, with a long account of how
it was to be done; but <ins title="original has is">it</ins> seemed simple and easy
enough, and I thought about it night and day. You
know that old box, Mr. Brian&mdash;the one in the master's
library at the Pines? Well, of course, I'd heard the
story about it, and seen it a good many times when I
was in doing odd jobs or helping with the cleaning.
I'd made up my mind that there must be money
inside it, and the thought came over me that if I
could get out enough to carry out the plan this
other fellow had proposed, I might make my fortune
and go abroad. The amount of money I'd taken I'd
send back to Mr. Ormond, with no name, but just a
note to say it had been taken out of his box."</p>

<p>"But why did you pretend you were going to
Australia?" asked Brian.</p>

<p>"I'm coming to that, sir. To avert suspicion, in
case anything went wrong and it was found that
the box had been tampered with, I made out I
was going to emigrate, and that I should have left
England the very night I was going to rob the box.
Mr. Brian, I'm no better than a common thief; but
I tell you solemnly, I meant to return what I took."</p>

<p>"But how did you open the sealed box?"</p>

<p>"I remembered that, sir, and for some time it puzzled
me to know what to do. I'm handy with tools and
that kind of thing. I knew I could pick the padlocks;
but if once I'd chipped the seals off, it would be seen
that the box had been opened. However, there seemed
no help for it, so I decided I must risk that much.
Late Friday night, or early Saturday morning, I forced
back the catch of the library window, and got into the
house that way. I got out the box, and was going to
begin by breaking the seals, when I thought of something
better. I went into the kitchen, found a carving-knife,
took it out into the tool-house, and ground
the blade very thin on the stone. I got some methylated
spirit out of the pantry, made a flame by burning
it in a tin dish, and so heated the knife. When
the blade was hot enough, I was able to slip it under
the seals, so that they came away whole."</p>

<p>"That accounts for the cork," muttered Brian.</p>

<p>"I got the box open," continued the man, "but
only to find that it contained nothing more than
a bundle of papers. I hadn't time to search them
through, but I thought there might be bank-notes,
or something of that kind among them, so I determined
I'd take them away. I had one fright, for
while I was doing this I heard the door pushed
open, and Bob came into the room. Of course he
knew me, and didn't bark. He must have jumped
in through the window while I was in the kitchen.
I chained him up again when I went away; but
first I refastened the box, and warming the backs
of the seals, put them in their former places, exactly
as they had been before. I walked all the way to
Chadstone that night, and put up at a little pub
there, making out I'd come to look for work. I
examined the papers, but found that they weren't
of any value to me or to any one but Mr. Ormond.
For several days I wandered about, hardly daring
to show my face in the daytime, sleeping anywhere
and half-starved, for what money I had went very
fast. One thing I was determined on&mdash;that I'd return
them papers; and you just about know all the rest.
I came that Thursday night, found the old box out
in the tool-house, picked the locks again, and put the
bundle in its old place, meaning to write Mr. Ormond
an anonymous letter and say where the packet was.
Then Miss Elsie came to the door and run away
screaming. I'd no time to escape, so I hid under a
heap of old matting. I heard you come into the place,
sir, but you didn't find me, and later on I crept out
and made off. I hid in an old barn most of yesterday
and to-day, because I was afraid Mr. Ormond
would smell a rat, and set the police on my track;
and now I was going to try and get something to eat
and then my idea was to walk to London."</p>

<p>For some minutes after the narrative had concluded
Brian stood hardly knowing what to say. There was
no doubt that Cole had been guilty of a serious offence;
yet, remembering what he had been in the past, and
seeing the change in him now, together with his evidently
genuine regret for what he had done, the boy
could not help feeling sorry, and anxious even to
render the unfortunate fellow some assistance.</p>

<p>"Look here, William," he said suddenly, "the very
best thing you can do is to come back with me now, and
make a clean breast of the matter to Mr. Ormond."</p>

<p>"Oh, I can't do that, sir!"</p>

<p>"Yes, you can. Tell him exactly what you told
me. He'll forgive you, I'm sure, and he'll advise you
what to do better than I can."</p>

<p>"He may have me sent to jail," said Cole. "Still,
I would rather face it, and take the consequences."</p>

<p>Brian's return to the Pines has already been described,
and little more remains to be told. Mr.
Ormond's astonishment was as great as his nephew's
had been, when he entered the library, and saw
William Cole standing there, cap in hand.</p>

<p>As the man related his story, his former master
listened with a grave face.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to hear this of you, William," he said at
length. "I couldn't have believed it possible. I suppose
you are aware that you ran the risk of being
sent to penal servitude?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, that I did, sir," was the answer. "But
don't give me up. Let me have another chance."</p>

<p>"As you returned the papers, I'm inclined to deal
leniently with you," said Mr. Ormond. "I hope this
may be a lesson to you to keep out of crooked ways
for the future. You have a brother in the north of
England, I believe? Go to him, and see if he can
help you to get work away from your old surroundings.
I'll lend you money for your railway fare."</p>

<p>Cole tried to express his thanks, but Mr. Ormond
cut him short with another warning to keep to straight
paths in future. This, to give the man his due, he
succeeded in doing, and a few months later was able
to return the sum advanced for his railway ticket.</p>

<p>There were no more mysteries in connection with
Uncle Roger's box, while Elsie so far recovered her
nerves that she soon learned to gallop round the
field when the promised pony came next spring.</p>
